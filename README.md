# NoobScience

But this time in a more minimal, neat and clean way.
Based on the concept of Digital Garden, this is a place where I will be sharing my thoughts, ideas, notes, and resources on various topics.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of notes, usually organized into sections, to help you keep track of your learning journey over time. It’s a concept that’s been around for a while, but it’s recently been gaining popularity among people looking for a better way to organize their thoughts and ideas. - [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

Some of the digital gardens that I like are:

- [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)
- [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/)

## Why am I doing this?

Um...because I really liked [Magie Appleton's](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) digital garden and wanted to make one for myself. Also, I think this is a great way to keep track of my learning journey and share my thoughts and ideas with the world.

## How am I doing this?

I am building upon an existing project of mine called [About_astro](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/About_astro) and sort of rewriting it to make it more minimal and clean.

Public Beta to be released soon.
