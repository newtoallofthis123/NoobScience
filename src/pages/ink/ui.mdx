title: Refactoring UI Notes
layout: "../../layouts/normal.astro"
---

Here are some brief notes that I wrote while I was reading the book
"Refactoring UI" by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger.
It is a very great book and I highly recommend reading it. These notes
cover most of the important points in the book, but not all of them.
The book also has good design examples that I did not include here.
So, if you are interested in design, I recommend reading the book.
After you are done reading the book, you can use these notes as a
reference.

## Initial Stage

Start with a feature, not a layout. Don’t start hierarchically. Start with designing the feature first.

Initially, don’t get hung up on making *low level* decisions like the Typeface, icons etc.

Hold the colors initially

This is a low fidelity design. Don’t get too attached. That is, at least initially, don’t design *too* much.

Have a brief idea of what you want to build.

Design in cycles. So, when you are happy with a good design, then proceed.

When Designing, expect the feature to be hard

If a part of the design is nice to have, build it later.

Don’t paint the building before the foundations are laid.

Choose a design personality and stick to it.

Like for example, a bank website may have like a professional vibe with the cool serif fonts, whereas your personal site can have something funky.

Small border radius is neutral, more is playful.

Make sure your actual text matches the website theme

Don’t borrow too much from other websites

Try to limit your choices as much as possible.

Define design systems in advance. This will help you limit your choices.

If you are not sure about something, implement everything and choose by the process of elimination

Make a good system for everything at the very start. This will help you not second guess your work.

## Working on Hierarchy

Design is more than creativity and style. It is to a certain extent about it, but it is much more than making something just look good

Visual Hierarchy is extremely important. Without it, the design feels weird and noisy.

Classify text as primary, secondary and tertiary. This makes it easier for you to design them appropriately.  

Don’t rely too much on just the font size to establish hierarchy.

The font weight and color can do some heavy lifting too.

For UI work, try sticking with two to three colors categorized as primary, secondary and tertiary. Two font weights as well.

Stay away from lighter weights. To deemphasize text, try using a lighter color instead.

Don’t use grey on colored backgrounds, instead choose a color of lighter hue.

Deemphasize to Emphasize

Labels are a last resort. Not everything has to labeled.

Instead of presenting values mathematically, present them as a sentence.

Labels, if necessary to put, are secondary.

Emphasize the label if you know the user will be looking at the label.

Don’t let HTML semantics influence your designs

Use contrast to compensate for weight and vis versa

Destructive buttons can be tertiary. They don’t have to be bold.

## Spacing and White Space

Always start with too much white space and reduce it subsequently.

White space is always to be reduced, not added.

Denseness should be deliberate, not automatic.

Limit your spacing to certain values that are pre defined. 

No two sizing parameters should be more than 25% in difference.

You don’t need to fill the whole space. Let the design breath a bit.

Not everything has to be full width

If are finding it difficult to design for the mobile as well as the web, try limiting the space on the desktop to fit the mobile. There is nothing wrong with that.

Split information in columns on the big screen

Grids are overrated (Thank you!)

Not all elements should be fluid. They can fixed. 

Fluid elements sometimes don’t scale well

Don’t use relative sizing to scale.

Try and stick to `px`.

Elements that are large on large screens need to shrink faster than elements that are already fairly small

Don’t try to scale everything proportionally. Give yourself the ability to fine tune.

Maintain correct spacing to maintain hierarchy

## Text

Choose a good text ratio. It can be like `4:5` or even the golden ration `1:1.618`.

A simpler approach is to just go with what looks good. Establish your own text scaling system.

Avoid `em` units. `px` scales much more functionally than `em`

For typefaces:

- Play it safe with the system font stack `-apple-system`
- Choose typefaces with more than 10 styles
- Optimize the font for legibility. Not style
- If a font is popular, it is probably good and your users is mostly accustomed to seeing it anyways.
- Be a type snob and develop your intuition

Your line height is very important.

Moreover, your line length is also very important. An average of 45 to 75 characters per line.

Don’t spread the text too much. 

Base line, not the center.

Take the following into account when deciding the line height

1. Font Size (Inverse)
2. Line Length (Direct)

Not every link needs a color. Just text emphasis will do the trick

Align text naturally. The user should not need to move his eyes too much to read.

Don’t center long form text. Just align it naturally.

Always right align numbers

Always enable word hyphenation with the `hypens: auto` option.

All caps legibility is improved with low letter spacing

## Colors

Ditch Hex for HSL

HSL Stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness. It is based on the inherent properties of the colors that we perceive

Example `hsl(220, 95%, 34%)`

Hue is a color’s position in the wheel. So, the 220 stands for blue

Saturation is how vivid a color looks. All the way from grey to bright

Lightness measure how light a color is

Think of more colors. Don’t just stick with the only colors in the color palette.

Define your shades up front
