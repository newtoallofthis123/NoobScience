The halloween week has been full of excitement and anticipation for apple fans around the globe, with Apple releasing the new iOS 17 and the new _iPhone 15_ to go with it.
Whole month has been filled with lots and lots of reviews, trials and tests by reviewers and enthusiasts. 
So, I have compiled a list of reasons why you should buy the new iPhone 15 and why it is worth your cart. Get your wallets ready and let's dive in.

## Major Camera Upgrade

Now Apple usually holds back on camera upgrades for their _S_ series of iPhones, but this time they have gone all out with the camera upgrades.
The new iPhone 15 comes with a 12MP camera with a 1.7 aperture and a 1.9 aperture for the telephoto lens and that is saying something.
This makes the new iPhone 15 on par with some of the basic DSLR cameras out there which is a huge deal for our ever growing social media needs.

Personally watching some of the comparisons between the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 14, I was blown away by the difference in the quality of the pictures.
The new A16 bionic chip, which we will be talking about in a bit also helps in the processing of the images and videos, making the iPhone 15 a beast in the camera department. 
Yes it has 3 cameras as well :)

So are you someone who is into photography or just wants to take _#instaworthy_ pictures, then I recommend you add it to your cart right away.

## The new dynamic Island

The dynamic island is the new feature that Apple had introduced in the iPhone 14 pro max. It is now however, a standard feature in the iPhone 15 standard series.
It is just awesome and it now actually does stuff. You can share contacts, check your swiggy order, buy stocks or even track your uber ride, all from the dynamic island.
It is just so convenient and it is just so cool. I mean, who doesn't want a dynamic island on their phone?

I mean, we all need to feel like Tony Stark once in a while, right? So, if you want to feel like Tony Stark, then the iPhone 15 is the way to go.

## A16 Bionic Chip / Awesome Performance

Apple is know for their performance and the A1 bionic chip is no exception. It features a 6 core CPU, 5 core GPU and a 4 core Neural Engine which makes the A16 bionic chip fast now and faster in the future.
The 4 core Neural Engine features a new architecture that accelerates the machine learning algorithms that power experiences like Live Text, Face ID, and more.

So no more slow downs, no more lag, no more waiting for the apps to load. Moreover, in the age of AI and chatbots, the A16 bionic chip seems to be the _only_ chip that can handle the load.
So, want the sweet taste of performance, then the iPhone 15 is the way to go.

## Durability and Titanium Body

Holding an iPhone and using it is a different experience altogether. The premium feel, the smoothness, the weight, the touch, everything is just perfect.
Now, add a premium titanium body to that and you have a phone that is just perfect. The titanium body makes the iPhone 15 lighter and stronger than ever before.
So you no longer need to worry too much about dropping your phone and breaking it. You still need to pay for Apple Care though ðŸ˜….

So have a kid that just loves to drop your precious phone, then the iPhone 15 is the way to go.

## USB Type C and Fast Charging

Ever been out in public and ran out of battery and you ask someone for a charger and they give you a USB Type C charger and you are like _"I have an iPhone"_.

Well, not anymore. The iPhone 15 finally comes with a USB Type C port. According to the EU regulations, all phones should have a USB Type C port by 2022 and Apple has finally decided to comply with it.
This is a __huge__ deal and this shows that Apple is finally ushering in the new era of homogeneous use of electronic devices.

Moreover, the new USB type C also comes with some under the hood improvements like faster charging, faster data transfers.
Finally you can use the same charger for your iPhone and your Macbook.

## The New iOS 17 is awesome!

iOS 17 is the release that ever Apple fan has been waiting for. It is the release that has so many under the hood improvements that it is hard to list them all.
I would recommend you to check out the [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/) for more details on the new iOS 17.

![iOS 17](https://www.apple.com/v/iphone/home/bp/images/overview/why-iphone/ios17__glwsbqdnc6um_large.jpg)

iOs 17 has major improvements in the messaging, calling, your privacy settings and so much more.
Also, small fan boy moment, but the new iOS 17 comes with a new set of emojis and they are just so cute.
Moreover, if you are automation enthusiast like me, then the new iOS 17 comes with a new automation app called _Shortcuts_ which is just amazing.
You know what they say: _"Why spend 5 minutes doing something when you can spend 5 hours automating it"_, but iOs 17 makes it such that it takes only 5 minutes to automate it.

## "Hey Siri, share this with Ishan"

Air Drop is one of the most used features of the iPhone and it is getting a major upgrade in the new iOS 17.
You can now just tap each other's phones and you can share files, photos, videos, contacts, and what not.
Moreover, you can also ask siri to do it for you! Just say _"Hey Siri, share this with Ishan"_ and it will do it for you.
PS: Share me memes, I love memes.

## The New Apple Watch and the Apple Watch OS 17

Once you try the Apple Watch, you can never go back. The Apple Watch is the perfect companion to your iPhone and it is getting it's own neat little 
17 update. The new Apple Watch OS 17 comes with a new set of watch faces, new apps, new features and so much more.
Moreover, the UI is now _even cuter_ and I didn't even know that was possible.

Moreover, if you are a fitness conscious person, then the Apple Watch is the perfect companion for you. It comes with a new set of fitness features that will help you track your fitness goals and help you achieve them.

## The cool new Action button

IPhone 15 comes with a cool new action button on the side of the phone. It is a small button that you can press to perform a set of actions.
Apple is calling it the _Action Button_ and I can already see the endless possibilities of this button.
You can use it to screenshot, open the camera and if you are a gamer, quickly open up your favorite game.

It is so convenient and a really underrated feature of the iPhone 15. So, if you are someone who likes to get things done quickly, then the iPhone 15 is the way to go.

## It's Apple!

Apple is known for it's quality and it's premium products. The iPhone 15 is no exception. It is the perfect phone for the perfect person.
I know there has been a bit of a controversy with the new iPhone 15 and the new iOS 17, but I think we need to look at it from a different perspective.
Apple is finally complying with the EU regulations and it is finally ushering in the new era of homogeneous use of electronic devices.
This will help us in the long run and it will help us in the fight against climate change.
We must support them in this noble cause.

There is a reason why Apple is the most valuable company in the world. It is because they make the best products in the world.
