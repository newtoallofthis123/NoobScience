**Sorting has always been like a weird rite of passage before Data Structures and Algorithms and I always find it funny that
one of the easiest things to do in modern programming is one of the hardest things to do in DSA.**

Sortings are used everywhere, most of the time, without much thought. But when you have to do it yourself, it becomes a
whole different ball game. There are a lot of different sorting algorithms and each of them has their own pros and cons.
So, I am going to go over them one by one and then talk about some other things related to sorting.
This is a jot, not complete notes. I will be adding more stuff to this as I learn more.
