Well, I don't usually write about my personal life on my blogs, but I am sure that some of it leaks
into the writing. I am not really sure I'll publish this, but I am writing it anyway.
If you know me in real life, first off Hi! Thanks for reading my blog, I would love to hear from you.
Secondly, you might know that I talk a lot and I pride myself on being able to talk about anything.
I am not really sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I am sure that it's a thing.

However, the thing that has been bothering me for quite sometime now, is that ever since
I started programming, my mind has a tuned to think in a certain way. I am not sure if that's
like a thing that all programmers go through, but it is for me.
I think quite programmatically, even subconsciously. I think in terms of if else statements,
while loops, for loops, and all that jazz.
Now, I know this would either sound weird or like a low key flex, but I am not sure if it's either.
You see, real life is not a binary system. It's not a bunch of if else statements.
You can't predict everything. You can't know everything. You can't control everything.

So, when I program, I know that I and the language I am using, have control over everything.
Hence, this stability allows me to make calculated guesses and decisions.
However, in real life, I can't do that.

Now, my mind as, I said, has been tuned to think in a certain way. So, when I am faced with a
situation where I don't know the answer, my first instinct is to find the answer.
However, in real life, you can't always find the answer. You can't always know the answer.
So, my mind starts to make a calculated guess.

Now this where the problem arises. Those guesses have too many variables. Too many unknowns.
Hence, simple probability, in the product of all those variables, the probability of the guess being
correct is very low. So, I end up making the wrong decision.

$\text{Probability of Guess being Correct} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P_i$

This gives rise to a whole new set of problems.
My information usually ends up being wrong and this is not a good thing.

So, I have been trying to change my mindset. I have been trying to change the way I think.
Now, I am not saying that I am trying to stop thinking programmatically, but I am trying to
think more about the situation at hand.
So, I want to work with more facts, rather than guesses. I want to work with more information,
rather than assumptions.

What really inspired me to write this post was a YouTube Video from the author of the 
popular book, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck", Mark Manson.
This is the video if you want to watch it:

<YouTube id="qJ8aRl1UNgw"/>

I really liked this one part of the video, where he says:

> The more you know, the more you know you don't know.

Here, he outlines how a lot of people think that they know everything, but in reality,
they don't know anything. They are just making guesses and assumptions.
I don't want to be that person. I don't want to be the person who thinks he knows everything,
gets stuck in an echo chamber and then ends up being the most ignorant person in the room.

Also, I observed this in my developer journey as well.
For example, when I started learning React, I thought I knew everything about it.
Then, once I actually got good at it, I realized how much I don't know about React.
I could outline exactly what I didn't. I could outline exactly what I needed to learn.
This is the same with everything in life. The more you know, the more you know you don't know.

Hence, from today, I want to follow 4 basic principles that I crafted for myself:

1. Don't assume or guess anything that involves real life implications.
2. You don't need to have an opinion on everything. Opinion is not a fact.
3. Don't be afraid to say "I don't know". There is no shame in not knowing something.
4. Information that you give to others should be factual and not based on assumptions or word of mouth.

There you go, that's it.
I am not sure if this post made any sense, but I just wanted to write it down.
So, if you know me in real life, I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Thanks for reading and hope you have a great day!
