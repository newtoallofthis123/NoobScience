Rarely does a platform become so popular that it becomes a verb.
Does anyone remember the last time they "Googled" something?
Exaclty. The point here being not the act of searching something on Google, but the popularity of the platform.
One such platform is GitHub. It is a platform for hosting code, but it is so much more than that.
If you are a developer, you have probably heard of it.
If not, GitHub is a bootstrapped and intuitive platform for hosting code and managing it using the open source system called Git.
It is a platform that is used by millions of developers around the world.
It was recently acquired by Microsoft for a whopping 7.5 billion dollars.

So, I decided to write a small post on why GitHub is as popular as it is.
Now, I am not a GitHub employee, nor do I have any affiliation with them.
However, I do appreciate the platform and use it on a daily basis.
So, with that being said, you might find some bias in this post.
Now that being said, platforms like GitLab and BitBucket are also great platforms that offer similar features.
However, I will be focusing on GitHub in this post.

## It is free

Now, this is quite obvious, but equally important.
Platforms like GitLab and BitBucket offer free plans as well, but they are quite limited.
GitHub, on the other hand, offers unlimited public repositories for free.
You can even have unlimited files in your repository. However, to prevent abuse, they limit the size of each file to 100 MB.
Which is still quite generous considering cloud storage is a major source of revenue for companies like Google and Microsoft.

Now, this ascept of GitHub is also very important for their public image and corporate policy.
GitHub always advertises itself as a platform for devs by devs and they have done comandable work 
towards making the platform more accessible to developers.
GitHub has also been a major contributor to the open source community.
They have contributed to many open source projects and have also open sourced many of their own projects.
