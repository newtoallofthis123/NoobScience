**I sometimes wonder if we as humans are becoming too materialistic for our own good.
Now mind you I am not a _anti capitalist_, let's all work together type of guy, but sometimes
I wonder, is there an end to it?**

We now live in a world where everything has to be _aesthetic_. I am pretty sure that there are
also aesthetic ways to travel that I am not aware of. Now mind you I am not a hippie, at least I don't think I am,
but I have never really been a fan of the whole aesthetic culture.
Now mind you I have no personal grudge against pretty things. You can and should send me a pretty gift.
However, something that I have a fundamental problem against is being ignorant due to the whole aesthetic culture.

The reason I am thinking all of this right now is because, today, was quite fun. For a little background, I love traveling and doing stuff.
So, today, me, my dad and my brother, all went a nice outing to _koti_, a local 
area in the older part of Hyderbad city, India. We did nothing significant, took the local
bus, which I am quite new to and just went to koti and came back.
Had a weirdly cute lunch at a local restaurant and that was that.

We usually travel in the comforts of the car, which turns out, unless an emergency, is one of the most 
boring ways to travel. Now don't get me wrong, I love driving and realize the importance of cars.
However, my general belief still holds. You wanna have fun and explore the place, *go by foot*.

Whenever I ever went out with my friends since I was young, I loved going without a fixed mode of transport.
The fun lies in figuring it out. Moreover, I cannot understate the environmental impact it has.
Sharing autos and public transport is excellent for our environment and we should be using them as much as possible.

I walked about 16000 steps today and boy was it fun. Wanna join me on the next one?
