I know I am late to the whole thing. By late I mean 3 years late.
But I finally started watching the 2020 master piece that is Normal People.
I rarely find a show or movie in the romance genre that I like. But this one is different.
Normal People had such a simple story, yet potrayed it in a way that can also be called complex.
The show is based on the book of the same name by Sally Rooney and man is it good.

I am not the one to get too emotional while watching a movie or a show. But this one got me.
My hand was a lot less on the skip button than usual. I was actually interested in the story.
Yet the story was so simple. It was just about two people who are in love with each other, but circumstances keep them apart.
Most of the circumstances are created by themselves. They are the ones who keep themselves apart.
This makes their journey so much more interesting. It is not just about the circumstances, but also about their own decisions.

## The Story

Let me just describe the story real quick without devling into too much detail, mostly because I don't want to spoil it for you.
The story is about two people, Marianne and Connell, who are in love with each other. They are in love with each other since high school.
So Marianne is the daughter of a rich family. She is a bit of a loner and doesn't have many friends. She is also a bit of a rebel.
She is mistreated by her family and especially her brother. Connell on the other hand is a popular kid in school. He is a football player and has a lot of friends.
Seems like your typical high school romance story right? Well it is not. It is so much more than that.

Then when Connell basically says that he doesn't want to be seen with Marianne in school, she is heartbroken.
However, when they go to college, the roles are reversed. Marianne is the popular one and Connell is the loner.
After this, the story is quite complex, with a lot of ups and downs.

Basically the story is about how they keep coming together and then drifting apart. It is about how they keep hurting each other, yet they are the only ones who can heal each other.
I mean, okay enough of me talking about stuff you can get off of wikipedia. Let me just talk about why I liked the show so much.

This is however, where I will stop using GitHub Copilot and want to just talk sometime. So you can probably expect bad grammer from this point.

## Histories and Damage

It is established pretty early on in the story that both of out main characters are quite broken.
Connell, like the budding writer he is always feels alone, even when he is in the crowd. As he describes his
point of view to a psychologist, he says he doesn't even like his friends that much and Marianne is the only person he 
actually feels himself with. The show also does this thing where it always shows distance and wide camera angles whenever the 
dialogue suggests that both of them are getting quite cozy.
So, we get to know that Connell is damaged, he is too scared of what people might think of him and is constantly scared to be himself
with anyone, not even his other girlfriends.

Marianne on the other hand, is a whole different story. She is damaged in a way that is quite hard to describe. She is a bit of a loner,
mistreated by her family and has a lot of self esteem issues.
I will not be diving too much into the rather explicit parts of the show but I will just say that she has a lot of issues with her self image.
She is constantly mistreated by her brother and her family and this seems to leak into her relationships as well. She is constantly mistreated by her boyfriends,
all expect Connell. The show does a great job of showing how she is constantly mistreated by her boyfriends and how she is constantly trying to please them.
It also conveys how she is constantly trying to please Connell as well, but in a different way. She is not trying to please him by being submissive, but by being herself.
Now, I have no experience in relationships, but I think that's a good thing to have.

One more thing, can we all just commend the awesome acting by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal. They are just so good at their roles.
They fit perfectly into the characters and I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles.
Paul Mescal is just so good at playing the role of a shy, introverted guy who is scared of what people might think of him and Daisy Edgar-Jones just 
carries the role of the mistreated, submissive, rebel girl.

## Character Development Arcs

The show does a great job of showing the character development arcs of both the characters.
Connell starts off as a shy, introverted guy who is scared of what people might think of him. He is scared of being himself.
But towards the end of the show, he is a lot more confident. He is a lot more sure of himself and is not scared of what people might think of him.
We see this when he bravely stands up to Marianne's brother and when he is able to stand up to his friends and tell them that he is dating Marianne.
The show also does an excellent job of potraying his mental health issues and how Marianne just seems to be the only one who can heal him.

Marianne on the other hand, starts off as a rebel. She is a bit of a loner and doesn't have many friends. She is also mistreated by her family.
However, in college, things seems to change. She is a lot more confident and is a lot more sure of herself. She is not scared of what people might think of her.
This is potrayed by how easily she breaks up with her boyfriend and how she is able to stand up to her brother. She is also a lot more confident in her relationship with Connell.
She is not scared of what he might think of her and is not scared of being herself with him.

However, the both again seem to drift apart. This is because of their own decisions. They are the ones who keep themselves apart.
Marianne goes into a complicated and absolutely toxic relationship with a guy named Jamie. She is constantly mistreated by him and is constantly trying to please him.
Then Jamie is replaced by a lot of other boyfriends, all of whom are quite toxic.
Connell on the other hand, is still in a weird place. He dates other people for a while, but as is apparent from the show, he is not really into them.
Both of them seem to only find solace in each other.

Hence the show makes a very good remark about your first romances and how they are the ones that you will always remember.
It also takes on important topics like mental health and abusive relationships.


## Just a Cool Edit

## Cinematography

I don't usually observe the cinematography of a show or a movie, but this one was just so good.
The perfectly timed wide camera angles, the perfectly timed close ups, the perfectly timed music, everything was just so good.
The show also does a great job of showing the passage of time. It shows the passage of time by showing the characters in different places.
It does time jumps very well and it is never confusing. It is always clear what is happening and when it is happening.
There are no weird flashbacks or flashforwards and everything is conveyed through conversations and the characters themselves.

This is also a great example of how to do a show with a lot of dialogue. The show is mostly just dialogue and it is just so good.
The dialogues however, don't seem boring because of the cinematography and the great acting.
The english is simple and very poetic. It is not too hard to understand and it is not too simple either.

## The Ending

Now, I am not really sure I understood the ending. I mean, I understood why it ended the way it did, but I am not sure I understood the ending.
The story basically ends by showing that both of them are in different places. Marianne is in Sweden and Connell is in New York.
However, they are still in love with each other. They still talk to each other and they still care about each other.
It is still very unclear if they are in a relationship or not. However, as the show potrays, you don't need to be in a relationship to be in love.
The whole show is about how they are in love with each other, but they are not in a relationship. They are not in a relationship because of their own decisions.
It seems quite apt that the show ends with them not being in a relationship, but still being in love with each other.

However, the story did give us a lot of hints that they will end up together. The show does a great job of this.
So, I hope, for the sake of my heart, that they do end up together.

## Conclusion

Overall, I really liked the show. That is quite apparent when I just watched the whole show in one day, with a submission deadline getting closer.
I would highly recommend you watch this show. It is a great show and it is a great example of how to do a show with a lot of dialogue.
I really enjoyed watching it and I hope you do too.

If I am not mistaken, the show is streaming on Hulu and BBC iPlayer. I have also never read the book, so I can't really comment on that.
I hope you enjoyed reading this article and I hope you enjoy watching the show.
