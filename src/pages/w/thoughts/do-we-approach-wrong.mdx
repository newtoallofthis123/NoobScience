**Our first words were not Hello World. 
We all have had to start somewhere or the other. We all had different motivations to start,
different ways of learning, and different ways of applying what we learned. Then why do we
try to standardize the way we teach programming?**

## Introduction

Now a days, especially in a place like India, everywhere I go, I see an advertisement for `learn to code`.
We all know the whole scams that take place in this space and all that stuff. Here in Hyderbad, India; there is a whole place purely dedicated for programming bootcamps on the latest skills that are in demand.
I know. Weird, but understandable.

Moreover, the most common question that gets asked is "How do I learn to code?". I have been asked this question a lot of times and I have answered it a lot of times. So, I thought, why not write a blog post about it. So, here I am.

This in my opinion atleast, is a good enough answer to the question "How do I learn to code?". So, without further ado, let's get started and if you know a friend who is struggling with this question, feel free to share this with them.

## Code is not the end goal

I wanted to start with a bang. So here I go. Most people, when they learn to code, focus way too much on the *code* part of it; often forgetting the reason programmers and programming itself exists in the first place.
Programming exists to *solve problems*. Big small, it doesn't matter. Programming is a tool to solve problems. So, when you are learning to code, don't focus on the code. Focus on the problem. Focus on the solution. Focus on the *why*.

It is quite easy to forget about this initially when you are learning to code and I don't really think that's necessarily a bad thing. I think it is important to learn the basics of programming first. However, once you have a good grasp on the basics, I think it is important to start focusing on the problem solving aspect of programming.
This is why I am such an advocate of project based learning. In project based learning, you don't care about the code. You care about solving an individual problem and the thing is, since you are actually able to see something you made, you are more motivated to learn and you are more motivated to solve the problem. This is far better than making a menu driven C program to find all the nodes in a linked list that exceed x. I mean, sure, you can do that, but I don't think that it is necessarily the best way to really get into programming.

Now I don't mean to say that stuff like a menu driven C program is not useful. All I mean to say is that though it teachs something very important, most of the times, it is quite boring. So, subconsiously, you don't really enjoy it. You might learn it just fine, but do you really think grumply typing 200 lines of code is good for your mental health? No wonder people think programming is hard. It's not. It's just that the way we teach ourselves that is the problem.

## It's not history

You don't need to know EVERYTHING about a programming language before you start using it. It is not history. You don't need to know what a particular class or a function does unless you *need* to use it explicitly.
This again ties in to the project based learning I was talking about. I know this is not a brag, but I didn't properly know how to use `useMemo` in React recently till I had to design this site's NavBar animations and I have written multiple lines of complex React logic and code for multiple projects. I didn't know how to use `useMemo` because I didn't need to use it. Best part? You know how I did learn how to use it? I just checked the React docs.
I didn't go through a 2 hour long tutorial on `useMemo`. I just checked the docs and I was done. I didn't need to know the history of `useMemo`. I just needed to know how to use it. That's it.
This is what I see most of my friends and peers finding a difficulty with. When I initially learning to code, I always felt bad whenever I couldn't remember what a function or a class did. It is completely okay to feel like that.
But there is nothing you can do.

> It's a canon event

Yes. It is something that every programmer goes through and eventually grows out of.
Now, most of my learning process now revolves around reading documentation, watching a few tutorials and just starting a test project. It's that simple. That is one advantage I can gurantee you as you learn to code.
You first language will be the hardest to learn. Once you do so, all your subsequent languages will be easier to learn. This is because you will have a good grasp on the basics of programming and you will know how to learn a new language. You will know how to read documentation. You will know how to use the Internet and all the resources it has to offer. You will know how to learn to code.

So yes. Please don't memorise functions. It is fine if you forget their names, hell even forget the function's name itself. There is a reason why documentation is included. We are not historians. We need not know what caused a war in the 1800s. We just need to know how to solve a weird problem.
So please keep that in mind the next time you feel bad about not remembering a function's name in a language, I am looking at you python.

## Coding is Simple. Programming is not.

I am sorry for bringing up the age old debate of coding vs programming, but I think it is important to talk about it. Coding in itself is the act of writing code. Programming is the act of solving problems using code.
So when you are learning to code, you are not learning to program. You are learning to code. You are learning the syntax of a language. What you want to do with that language is up to you. You can use it to solve problems, or you can use it to make a game. It's up to you.

Now if you want an example of where coding doesn't matter at all, just visit the solutions tab of any leetcode problem, and you will find a bunch of solutions in different languages. All of them solve the same problem, but they are all written in different languages. So, the code doesn't matter. What matters is the solution. What matters is the algorithm. What matters is the problem solving aspect of programming.

Now since the rise of GPT's and LLM's you can convert your shity code from one language to buggy code of another language with the click of a button. So yes, coding is simple. Programming is not. Programming is hard. Programming is complex and it is the fundamental thing that all of us should strive to learn.

## Don't fret about the language

I know this is a very common advice, but I think it is important to talk about it. I have seen a lot of people fretting about which language to learn. I have seen people asking questions like "Which language should I learn?" or stuff like "Which language is the best?" trending on Google and Reddit and I think it is important to talk about this.

Once, again, I want to go back to my "solving a problem" analogy. When you are learning to code, you are learning to solve problems. You are not learning a language. You are learning to solve problems. So, it doesn't matter which language you learn.
We are in a place right now where there is a new meta framework or a new language every week. So, it is important to understand that it doesn't matter which language you learn. This is infact, in my humble opinion, a good thing
With the introduction of so many new languages and frameworks, I am observing a pattern in all of them. They are slowly all becoming the same. They are all becoming more and more similar to each other. So, it doesn't matter which language you learn, the concepts of them will be very similar.

So for example, if you want to learn React, don't learn just React code. Learn data fetching, learn state management, learn site optimization and stuff like that. Don't like React? That's okay, now you know all the concepts you need for using Vue. Just look up it's documentation, check all the concepts and start *writing code*.

Once you start by doing this, you will soon find that all the languages are the same. They are all just tools to solve problems. So, don't fret about the language. Just start coding.

## LeetCoding

Now I do not want to offend anyone. I know that LeetCoding is a very popular way to learn to code and I know that it is a very good way to learn to code. I am not saying that it is bad. I am just saying that it is not the only way to learn. I have always been a project based learner, so I am not sure if it is good thing, but I only recently started LeetCoding. I have been coding for 2 years now and I only started LeetCoding a few months ago. I am slowly growing to competitive programming, but I am not there yet. I am still learning, so I am going to keep this section short.

I will probably wirte another article on my exprience with the wonderful platform that is Leetcode.

## Talk Tech

This is a very over looked topic in my opinion, but this is very important. Start talking tech with anyone and everyone who is willing to listen. I know that this is a very hard thing to do, but it is important. It has many benefits. Maybe try finding a coding partner or a coding buddy. Maybe try finding a mentor, anyone will do, as long as they are willing to listen to you talk about tech.
Talking and living in the tech space will help you by keeping you up to date with the latest trends and will also help your mental health my just venting out all the frustrations you have with your code.

Talking also has this weird effect of making you realize the mistake you have in your code or the mistake you have in your logic. I have had many instances where I was talking to my friend about a problem I was facing and I just realized the mistake I had in my code. This is the reason for the rubber duck debugging method. It is a very effective method. Although, it is 2023 and it need an upgrade. You know the latest version of the rubber duck debugging method? It's called ChatGPT. I will touch more on this later.

Also, start watching general content about programming. Maybe a casual video about a new framework or a new language. Maybe a video about a new algorithm or a new data structure. All this may seem insignificant, but it is important. It will help you keep up to date with the latest trends and will help you think in a more abstract way.
Programmers are not lone nerds. We are only that sometimes. So, let's start talking tech.

## Give Up but Don't Quit

Sorry for once again using a nuance in the english language to convey my point, but there is a small nuace between giving up and quiting.

I give up on a problem 100 times a day, but never quit.
It is human nature to get tired and frustrated. So maybe take a break, go for a walk, watch a movie, play a game, do whatever you want to do, but don't quit. I know programming is hard sometimes, but you know what? It is hard for everyone and that is okay.

Being stuck on a problem is okay, so, get up, take a break, come back later and either spam stackoverflow or ask ChatGPT for help. It's fine to not know everything. It's okay to ask for help. People in the tech community are usually very helpful and will help you out. So, don't quit. Just give up for a while.

## Use Modern Tools

Now I know there is a case for old tool and languages. There has to be someone to maintain all our old banking systems written in COBOL and stuff, but I think it is important to use modern tools. That does not mean always seeking out the latest tools and services. HTML is like 30 years old and it is still used today. So, it is important to use modern tools, but it is also important to use tools that are stable and have a good community around them.

So, please stop using DevC or Turbo C or whatever. There is a reason why so many people use React or Python or whatever. It is because they are stable and modern tools that have a great community around them with a lot of resources to learn from.

I know there is a case to be made for learning to code using C and I am not about to question people who are far more experienced than me, but I think it is important to use modern tools.

Now I know that this is a very controversial topic and I am not going to go into it. I am just going to say that it is important to use modern tools.

## Learn to use AI

This section of the traditional "How to learn to code" article is usually reserved for learning to use Google, but due to the recent advancements in AI, I think it is important to learn to use AI. Trust me when I tell you this, but you can learn 10x faster if you know how to use AI.
Please do not be scared of using AI, nor view it as a threat. It is just a tool that you can use to learn to code. It might not take your job, but it will definitely help you learn to code.

You can use AI to ask for help when you stuck, AI is expert at parsing through documentation and giving you suitable answers. You can use AI to generate code for you etc. I see many programmers now a days who view AI generated code as something guilty and I think it is important to change that. AI generated code is not something to be ashamed of. I know that it might be buggy and it might not be the best, but it is still code. It is still a solution to a problem that needs *you* the programmer to solve.

So, I believe that with the help of LLM's, you will be able to learn to code much faster than you would have been able to do so without it and I have to clarify; by learn to use AI I do not mean prompt enginnering. I mean stuff like GitHub Copilot and stuff like that.

One thing I would like to add about code generated by AI is that you should never use it to write critial business logic. Try to do that on your own, but if you are stuck, then you can use AI to help you out.
Also, don't just depend on AI, also get good with Google. Google is a very powerful tool that can help you learn to code much faster than you would have been able to do so without it.

## My Journey

Now since this is an article on the nuances of learning to code, I thought that it would be incomplete without plugging in my journey as a programmer. So, here it is.
It is not a part of the article, although it might make where I am coming from a bit more clear.
If you want to skip this, then you can do so. Just click [here](#conclusion).

I started coding when I was 16. Well technically I wasn't coding. I was just downloading all sorts of software
and testing them and out and stuff. The way I got into coding is actually really funny to me (it might be weird to you).
Well, I was just casually watching YouTube one day as you do and I came across a video of a guy speaking about the open software movement and tech privacy. Mind you at this point I was a heavy laptop user, so this really stuck with me. 

> "Oh my god! My data is being sold to companies!"

Yep. Believe it or not, this is where I started delving into the facinating world of tech. I would download multiple open source software, test them out, play with them, check their source code, and then move on to the next one. I was just a curious kid. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know what I was looking for. I was just having fun.
Then one day, I realized, I was downloading a lot of this stuff from [GitHub](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123). So I was like: Let's check it out. Then, when I did check GitHub out, I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a maintainer of my own open source project that fights against the big tech companies. I wanted to be a part of the open source movement. I wanted to be a part of the tech privacy movement. What would I do though?

I had a brilliant idea. I had already gone through my "starting a YouTube channel" phase and I had published a video titled "Firefox configuration for security and privacy". If you go watch that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StbADt_0O80), you will see that it is dated 2 years.
So, my idea was, why not I copy my profile in Firefox (without the data ofcourse), package that up as a self extracting `.exe` 7zip archive and give it like a cool name. 
The cool name I thought of was "Secura Fire". Don't judge the 16 year old boy.

I actually did it. You can find the GitHub repo [newtoallofthis123/SecuraFire](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/SecuraFire) or even visit the GitHub pages I set up with a lot of hard work [here](https://newtoallofthis123.github.io/SecuraFire/). Remember this was a huge deal for me at that time. I was so very proud. Now this is the point where I stagnated for a really long time. I was mostly testing out software, installing Ubuntu, stuff like that.
However, the change, once again, came in the form of a YouTube video of introduction to python. I tried it out, followed the instructions to the point and I had a calculator, where I had to manually edit the values in a jupyter notebook and boy was I in love. I loved the fact that I could now build something. 

I started watching python tutorials, reading up about it online, doing small projects, copying off projects on GitHub, you name it. I was obsessed with python and everything about it. I really enjoyed this phase in my life and I still do.
It took me about 6 months of doing a lot of projects in python like a notepad I was very proud of called [NoobNote](https://newtoallofthis123.github.io/NoobNote) and others. Now, here is where things start to get interesting. NoobNote was a notepad alternative I had written in tkinter. It was one of my first big projects with a lot of lines of code and I was quite proud of it.
Now I wanted a website for it that was inspired by the Sublime text editor's website. The only problem? I don't know how. So, cue the coding music. This is where I discovered [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). A non profit organization that gives out thousands of tutorials for free to well, teach you how to code.
So, I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript by making their cat app and much more. I was pretty okay with them. This is also around the same time that I made most of Brad Traversy's 50 HTML projects.
After learning all of this, I finally made NoobNote's website. When I was learning however, I came across this python framework called Flask. I was like: "What is this?". I checked it out and I was like: "Oh my god! I can make websites with python!". I was so excited. I started learning Flask and I was in love with python once again. I made a pastebin alternative called [NoobPaste](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/NoobPaste).
Then while I was learning flask, I wanted to optimize NoobPaste, so I started learning about JAMStack, made a portfolio etc and basically never looked back. I was in love with web development. I was in love with python. I was in love with programming. I was in love with tech.

So this was my journey. I started with a simple curiosity and ended up with a passion for tech. I am still learning. I am still growing. I am still making mistakes and hopefully, learning from them. 

So first up, sorry for going on a tangent there. However, before I delve into learning to code, I wanted to giev a little background on me and my journey, so that you can understand where I am coming from. Now, before you start reading futher, I think it is important for me to mention that I am just a student. It's only been 2 years since I am in this field. So, I may not give the industry standard advice you are looking for. I am just a student who is sharing his thoughts on the matter. So, take everything I say with a grain of salt, or don't take it at all. It's up to you.

## Conclusion

I think it is necessary for me to iterate this one more time but learning to code, anything for that matter is a very personal and subjective thing. So, I am not saying that you should follow my advice. I am just saying that this is what worked for me and I hope that it works for you too. So, if you do like my advice, then please do follow it, but if you don't, then that's okay too. I am not forcing you to do anything.

However, if you know someone who is struggling with this stuff, then please do share this article with them. I am sure that they will find it helpful.

So, that's it. That was my take on the traditional "How to learn to code" article. I hope you enjoyed reading it. I know that I have not covered a lot of stuff, but I think that this is a good start. I will probably write more articles on this topic in the future, so keep an eye out for that.
