Let's start off strong shall we: I want you to right now google _anything_ in the 
"best of _" realm. So it can be "best laptops 2022", "best food recipes", anything and if
you have way too much free time like I do, I want you to go through the results, actually click on the link,
let google get that into your permanent record and see the content in the sites.
Do this for about 3 keywords and you'll get to a striking realization. That you have read the same 
thing just mixed up and wasted half an hour of your life. Congrats. Welcome to the team.

Now sorry if that previous passage sounded a little passive aggressive, but sadly, it is the current state of the internet.
Don't get me wrong, there are tons of great sites on the internet that provide good quality content.
