See if this is familiar. You ever get a random notification or email from a service you signed up
for a while ago and it reads something along the line of "Hey! Try pro for free for a month!" or
"Upgrade to pro for free for a month!"?, if not, signup for more streaming services :).
So, especially if you're a student, you might be tempted to try out the pro version of the service.
I mean, who doesn't want free stuff?

Here's where I come in. I'm going to give you a small piece of advice. Don't do it. Don't try it.
Just don't. I know it's tempting, but don't. Read on to find out why.

## The Free Service

I can't exactly trace back the moment where the idea of a free service was born, but once it did, 
it took the software world by storm. The idea was simple, give the user a taste of the service,
and if they like it, they'll pay for it.

This was the birth of the trial period and the freemium model. The trial period is a period of time
where the user can try out the service for free, and the freemium model is a model where the user
can use the service for free, but with limited features.
Now, both of these have their own pros and cons and I will be delving into them later on in this post, but
first let's concentrate on bringing about why exactly these models were created.

In the early days of software, the only way to get software was to buy it. You had to pay for the whole
thing and whether you liked it or not, you were pretty much stuck with it.
Hence in the early days, people mostly relied on word of mouth to find out about software. If a friend
of yours recommended a software, you would probably buy it, or better yet, maybe you are part of a 
community of enthusiasts who share their experiences with software. This is how software was sold in
the early days. Not through ads, but through word of mouth.
Ads did exist, but they were mostly in the form of magazines and newspapers. The internet was still
in it's infancy and the importance of it was yet to be properly discovered.
This model pretty much worked for the earlier days of software since most of our software were quite 
rudimentry, compared to our products today. Moreover, they just didn't have that kind of a market.

Now, let's fast foward a bit in time to where the internet was gaining traction and more and more internet companies were being founded.
This is popularly known as the [dotcom boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) of the 1990's.
Now suddenly, everyone had relatively easy access to the internet and the internet's future was looking bright.
This is when the idea of a free trial was born. The idea, once again, was quite simple, give the user a taste of the service,
let them check the product out, and if they like it, they'll pay for it. The user gets to try out the
service before committing to it, and the company gets a potential customer that would have otherwise
never tried out the service.

This model was also partially made possible with the _help_ of the internet. Now, developers
could easily write business logic that would allow the user to try out the service for a limited
period of time, as long as they had a unique identifier, like an email address. This was the birth
of the trial period and the eventually, the freemium model.
This could be reflected in old applications like WinRAR, where you could use the software for free
for a limited period of time, and then you would have to pay for it.
I mean, you could still use it for free, but you would have to deal with the annoying popup that
would appear every time you opened the application.

### Was it profitable?

Now, in an economic stand point, this model was quite profitable. The company would get a potential
customer that would have otherwise never tried out the service. This is the same logic behind modern
day companies giving out huge discounts to refereed customers. The company would get a customer that
would have otherwise never even know about them. 

However, this did not come with a lot of problems. The biggest problem was that the company would
have to come up with a bullet proof way to prevent the user from using the service after the trial
ended and also go through the hassle of uniquely identifying the user and also keeping a track of the
transactional history of the user. This was a lot of work, and it was not worth it for a lot of
companies. This is why a lot of companies just gave out the software for free, but with limited
features. Here was the birth of the freemium model.

### The Freemium Model

The freemium model offered something very special and unique to the user. It offered the user a
change to not have to pay for the service at all. Not even a trial period. The user could just 
download or use the service, free of charge or any hassle. Maybe a few ads here and there, but
overall, far better than paying actual money that you could use to buy gas or food.
