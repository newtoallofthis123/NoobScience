                        You know how some stuff are just so good that they never get old?
                        Well, I have some of those too. I call them my evergreen posts.
                        They are long, detailed and are meant to be read slowly.
                        So, grab a cup of coffee and enjoy!

                        please share them with your friends and family.

                        This is in a sense, my personal internet space, or for the nerds out there, my digital garden.
                        The concept of a digital garden is not new, but it is not very popular either.
                        So, basically a digital garden is a place where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and opinions.
                        These do not have to be perfect, they can be rough, and they can be incomplete, but still out there.
                        So, this in a sense, becomes a peaceful and safe place for me to share my thoughts.
                        Obviously other people can read it too, but I am not writing for them, I am writing for myself.
                        So, in a sense, tending to a digital garden is like tending to a real garden.
                        You plant seeds, you water them, you take care of them, and you watch them grow.
                        And that is what I am doing here.
