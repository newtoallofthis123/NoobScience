## Research and Writing Approach

At NoobScience.rocks, we prioritize ethical and transparent content creation. Our articles and blog posts are the result of meticulous research, critical analysis, and a dedication to providing accurate and reliable information to our readers.

When it comes to researching from sources, we ensure:

- **Source Diversity**: We gather information from a wide range of reputable sources to present a well-rounded view on a subject.

- **Fact-Checking**: We strive to fact-check our content and provide accurate information. However, if any inaccuracies are found, we are committed to promptly correcting them.

- **Citations**: We provide proper citations to give credit to the original creators of the ideas, concepts, and data we reference.

## Personal Opinion and Impartiality

While we aim to provide balanced and impartial insights, it's important to note that much of what we write is influenced by personal opinion. Our articles reflect the current thinking and perspective of the author at the time of writing. They do not necessarily represent the views of our employer, college, family, or any other entity.
