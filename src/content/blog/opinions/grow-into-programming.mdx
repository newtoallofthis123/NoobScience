This October marks 3 years since I started programming. 
Do I feel good? Yeah obviously! I love coding and my passion for programming has 
only grown since when I started. I love learning new stuff, trying to keep 
up with whatâ€™s new and just over all have a great time.

Talking cool stuff about programming however is not why I am writing this article. 
The reason I am writing this article is well, I wanted to talk about something that 
doesnâ€™t get said very often in programming. I _know_ I am not like a senior dev 
with all this cool experiences and anecdotes I can tell you, but yeah I can tell 
you are few anecdotes from my own learning experiences. So buckle up my friend.

Programming is not something you learn. In my opinion, it is like an art form that 
is perfected through smart repetition and having genuine interest. Some of the best programmers 
I have ever had the pleasure of talking to are some the most humble and amazing 
people that really love what they do and are pretty good at it. That is 
something that is taken for granted quite often actually. Programming is not a 
skill, it is an art. Yes I know I sound like a old couple in a old museum, 
but I mean it.

Now you might be wondering about what point I am trying to convey, well, I will start 
trying to convey it now. You cannot become an expert in programming
