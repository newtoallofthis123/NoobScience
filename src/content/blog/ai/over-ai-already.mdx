## Glorious Beginnings

ChatGPT was released to the open public on November 30, 2022 and it changed the landscape of AI.
It went from something that was only talked in academic circles to something that _everyone_ had an opinion on 
or atleast tried out. It was the first time that AI was so accessible to the public.
Open AI, the research company behind ChatGPT, had released a few other models before but GPT-3 was their success story.
They went from a privately funded research company to a billion dollar company in a matter of days.
Yes, you read that right, days. Microsoft purchased a huge stake in Open AI and integrated it into their 
Bing search engine. Google was not far behind, soon both releasing it's own versions of GPT-3, Bard.

### The Hype

ChatGPT was a game changer. It was so perfect and so human like that it was hard to believe that it was a machine.
I mean, technically just a very clever mathematical model but still.
It was so hard to believe. I remember the first time I tried it out. I was blown away.
Funny story actually, I first thought it was like Google Assistant or Siri, and asked it today's weather.
Then it was like "As a large language model, I don't have access to that information..." and you know the rest by now.
