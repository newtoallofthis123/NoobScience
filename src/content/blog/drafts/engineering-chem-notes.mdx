Okay, so I think I have to start preparing for my exams, so welcome to Engineering Chemistry notes!

## 1. Atomic Structure

So, to start with a classic, Atomic and Molecular Structure.

Atomic orbitals are defined as a 3d region or space around the nucleus where the probability of finding an electron is maximum.
They are very different from the planetary model of the atom, where electrons revolve around the nucleus in a fixed orbit.
The charecteristics of atomic orbitals are determined by the quantum numbers, which are the solutions of the Schrodinger wave equation.

> Schrodinger Wave Equation: $$\hat{H}\psi = E\psi$$

Upon expanding, the wave equation is as follows

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2} + \frac{8\pi^2m}{h^2}(E-V)\psi &= 0
\end{align}
$$

The solution of this equation is given by the wave function $$\psi$$, which is a function of the coordinates of the electron and the time.
