The Web is a weird and wacky place. It always interests me how people behave on the internet.
I mean, the whole concept is quite cool honestly. Think about it, the internet, at least it was meant to be, a 
place where you can be unapologetically yourself. You can be whoever you want to be.
Want to test that? Go to any site of the old internet, and you will find a lot of people who are just being themselves.
You will find blogs of people who are just writing about their lives, their thoughts, or sometimes, just about their cats. 
Quite cool if you ask me.

But, the internet is not like that anymore. It is a place where you have to be careful about what you say, what you do, and what you post.
Now, is it a bad thing? Yes and no.
I'll be discussing more about this further in the post, but first, let's talk about why the internet is not the same anymore.

## Nerdy Beginnings

During the initial days of the internet, it was a very niche thing. 
I mean, maybe you had a computer, but probably you didn't have the internet.
And even if you had the internet, you didn't have a lot of people to talk to.
It was a weird wacky place, and if you were on it, ~~you were probably a nerd~~.
Okay, scarp that, you were definitely a nerd.

But, now, the internet is everywhere.
Everyone and their grandma is on the internet.
I am sure the next big thing will be dogs on the internet.
I would love to see that, but I digress.
Point being, we are now one with the internet.
However, how did we get here?

### The Internet
Internet is not a singular thing. It is a vast shed that encompasses a lot of things.
Things that you may not even know about.
Like did you know that the internet is not the same as the web?
The internet is the infrastructure that allows you to connect to other computers.
The web is the thing that you see on your browser.
The internet, in it's core, is just a bunch of very long wires that connect computers.
It is ficklingly cool if you ask me.
Anyways, I am getting off track again.
What I am trying to say is that the internet is a vast place.
It is not just the web, it is not just social media, it is not just the _dark web_.
The internet is a concept so cool that I believe that it is the epitome of human achievement.
I mean, we have literally connected the whole world together.
That is so cool.

Now, I think you had enough of me fan boying over the internet, but I am not done yet.
I want to talk about the web.

### The Web

> _Internet_ was the key to connecting the world, but the _Web_ was the key to connecting the people.

The web is quite different from the internet. And I don't want to be the "well, actually" guy, but the web is not the internet.
The web or the World Wide Web is a collection of websites that are connected to each other.
The whole thing of how the web works and some of the core entities and foundations that make it work is quite interesting.
However, I want to make a longer post about that, so I'll leave that for later.
For now, let's just say that the web is a collection of websites that are connected to each other.

Now, the web is a very interesting place.
I mean, yes, internet was the key to connecting the world, but the web was the key to connecting the people.
The web is a place where you can be yourself, and you can be whoever you want to be.
However, there was a small problem.
Initially, you only had 2 or maybe 3 ways you can express yourself on the web.
You could either write a blog, or you could make a website, or you could make a forum.
A forum was a place where you could talk to people about a specific topic, whereas a blog was a place where you could write about your life.
A website on the other hand was a place where you could put whatever you wanted to put.
These were on the first types of parasocial relationships that were formed on the web.
And they were quite cool.

I am part of the generation that missed the initial days of the web.
I was born in 2004, and by that time, the web was already a thing.
By the time I was old enough to use the internet, the web was already dying and social media was taking over.
I mean, I am not complaining, but I would have loved to see the initial days of the web.
I know the era had many problems: Unmoderated forums, grooming, and a lot of other things.
I am not saying that the initial days of the web were perfect, neither am I saying that they were better than what we have now.
However, I am saying that they were different, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way.

All of this was willy nilly, and it was quite cool.
However, the web had some serious problems as I had mentioned before.
Let's look at some of them and then we will look at how they were solved.

### Problems with the Web
- **Unmoderated Forums**: I mean, this is a no brainer. Unmoderated forums are a breeding ground for hate speech, grooming, and a lot of other things.
- **Weird Websites**: I mean, I don't know if this is a problem, but it is definitely a thing. There are a lot of weird websites on the web.
- **Less Accessibility**: The web was not accessible to everyone. You had to be a little bit tech savvy to be able to use the web.
- **Largely Text Based**: The web was largely text based. You had to be able to read and write to be able to use the web.

So, what happened? How was social media the solution to all of these problems?

## Social Media and the New Web

The web was a place where you could be yourself, and you could be whoever you wanted to be.
However, as I had mentioned before, there were only a few ways you could express yourself.
You had be atleast a little bit tech savvy to be able to express yourself on the web and that was a problem.
Now, the law of Silicon Valley is that if there is a problem, you have to solve it.
And that is exactly what happened.

Enter social media.
Social media was the solution to nearly all of the problems that the web had.
It ended up creating a whole new set of problems, but we will get to that later.
However, first let's look at how social media solved the problems that the web had.

### Answer to the Problems

1. **Moderation**: Social media solved the problem of moderation. 
It was a place where you could be yourself, but you had to follow the rules.
These rules were initially quite lax, but they became more and more strict as time went on.
Content moderation is a very interesting topic, and I would love to talk about it in a future post.

2. **Accessibility**: Social media solved the problem of accessibility.
You didn't have to be tech savvy to be able to use social media.
Anyone can use social media, and that is the beauty of it.
You can be a 10 year old kid, or you can be a 90 year old grandma, you can use social media.
I mean, I don't know if you should, but you can.

3. **Multimedia**: Social media solved the problem of multimedia.
A social media platform was most likely backed by a company, and that meant that they had a lot of money.
This meant that they could afford to host a lot of multimedia content.
I mean, this was an obvious upgrade from the mostly self hosted websites that were on the web.
You had reliable hosting, and you had a lot of storage.

4. **More People**: Social media solved the problem of less people.
Social media was a place where everyone was.
You could find your friends, your family, and even your dog on social media.
I mean, that was the whole point of social media.
It was a place where you could connect with people.

### A Picture of You

So, hey, social media solved all of the problems that the web had.
It was a perfect solution to all of the problems that the web had.
Social media made us more connected than ever before and we loved it for that.
We as users loved social media, and the companies loved it too.
It was a win-win situation for everyone.
People were getting more connected, and the companies were getting more money.
I mean, you were probably talking to your friends on social media.
You were probably sharing your life, your thoughts, and your feelings on social media.
It was an accurate description to "YOU".
