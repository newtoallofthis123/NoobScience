Arrays in c are not always the best and are sometimes more pain then they are worth.
For example, if I want to add an element to an array, I have to create a new array with a larger size, copy all the elements from the old array to the new array, and then add the new element to the new array.
This is a lot of work and is not very efficient. This is where linked lists come in.

## What is a linked list?

A linked list is a data structure that is made up of nodes that are linked together.
Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
By convention, the last node in the list points to a null pointer.

```c
struct node{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
} *head;
```

Hence, we get something like this:

## Complexities

The complexities of linked lists and arrays are compared below:

| Operation | Array | Linked List |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access | O(1) | O(n) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) |
| Insertion | O(n) | O(1) |
| Deletion | O(n) | O(1) |

Hence, as you can clearly see from the complexities, arrays are ideal or reading, whearas linked lists are ideal for insertion and deletion.
So, in most cases, linked lists are finally stored as arrays in databases for faster access.

## Implementing a linked list

The following functions are implemented in the code below:

- `createNode()` - Creates a new node
- `insert` - Inserts a node at a given position in the list
- `delete()` - Deletes a node from a given position in the list
- `display()` - Displays the list

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Node structure and head pointer to NULL
struct node{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
} *head = NULL;

// Function to create a new node
struct *node *createNode(int data){
  struct node *newNode = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  newNode->data = data;
  newNode->next = NULL;
  return newNode;
}

// Function to create a new node
void insert(int data, int pos=0){
  struct node *newNode = createNode(data);
  if(pos == 0){
    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;
  }
  else {
    struct node *temp = head;
    for(int i = 0; i < pos - 1; i++){
      temp = temp->next;
    }
    newNode->next = temp->next;
    temp->next = newNode;
  }
}

// Function to delete a node
void delete(int pos){
  struct node *temp = head;
  if(pos == 0){
    head = temp->next;
    free(temp);
  }
  else {
    for(int i = 0; i < pos - 1; i++){
      temp = temp->next;
    }
    struct node *temp2 = temp->next;
    temp->next = temp2->next;
    free(temp2);
  }
}

// Function to display the list
void display(){
  struct node *temp = head;
  while(temp != NULL){
    printf("%d ", temp->data);
    temp = temp->next;
  }
  printf("\n");
}

```

## A Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node points to the first node.
So, this in turn prevents unnecessary traversal to find the last node. Moreover, it also helps
prevent memory leaks.

A circular linked list looks something like this:

## Implementing a circular linked list

The following functions are implemented in the code below:

- `createNode()` - Creates a new node
- `insert` - Inserts a node at a given position in the list
- `delete()` - Deletes a node from a given position in the list
- `display()` - Displays the list

<small>Operations in Circular Linked List</small>
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};

struct node *head = NULL;

struct node *getNode(int data)
{
  struct node *newNode = (struct node *)(malloc(sizeof(struct node)));
  newNode->data = data;
  newNode->next = NULL;
  return newNode;
}

void insert(int data, int pos)
{
  struct node *newNode = getNode(data);
  if (pos == 0)
  {
    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;
  }
  else
  {
    struct node *current = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < pos - 1 && current != NULL; i++)
    {
        current = current->next;
    }
    if (current == NULL)
    {
        printf("Invalid position, cannot insert.\n");
        free(newNode);
        return;
    }
    newNode->next = current->next;
    current->next = newNode;
  }
}

void display()
{
  if (head == NULL)
  {
    printf("List is empty.\n");
    return;
  }

  struct node *temp = head;
  while (temp != NULL)
  {
    printf("%d -> ", temp->data);
    temp = temp->next;
  }
  printf("NULL\n");
}
```

## A Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a linked list where each node has two pointers, one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node.
So, this in turn prevents unnecessary traversal to find the previous node.

A doubly linked list looks something like this:

## Implementing a doubly linked list

The following functions are implemented in the code below:

- `createNode()` - Creates a new node
- `insert` - Inserts a node at a given position in the list
- `delete()` - Deletes a node from a given position in the list
- `display()` - Displays the list

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
  struct node *prev;
} *head = NULL;

struct node *getNode(int data){
  struct node *newNode = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  newNode->data = data;
  newNode->next = NULL;
  newNode->prev = NULL;
  return newNode;
}

void insert(int data, int pos)
{
  struct node *newNode = getNode(data);
  if (head == NULL)
  {
    head = newNode;
  }
  else if (pos == 0)
  {
    newNode->next = head;
    head->prev = newNode;
    head = newNode;
  }
  else
  {
    struct node *current = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < pos - 1 && current != NULL; i++)
    {
      current = current->next;
    }
    if (current == NULL)
    {
      printf("Invalid position. Node will be added at the end.\n");
      struct node *last = head;
      while (last->next != NULL)
          last = last->next;
      last->next = newNode;
      newNode->prev = last;
    }
    else
    {
      newNode->next = current->next;
      newNode->prev = current;
      if (current->next != NULL)
          current->next->prev = newNode;
      current->next = newNode;
    }
  }
}

void display(){
  struct node *current = head;
  while(current != NULL){
    printf("%d->", current->data);
    current = current->next;
  }
}

void rev_display()
{
  struct node *current = head;
  while (current->next != NULL)
  {
    current = current->next;
  }
  while (current != NULL)
  {
    printf("%d->", current->data);
    current = current->prev;
  }
  printf("NULL\n");
}
```

## A Stack using Linked List

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be deleted from the stack.
A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. When implemented using a linked list, the top of the stack is the head of the linked list.

```c
struct node{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
} *head = NULL;

void push(int ele){
    struct node *newnode;
    newnode = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    newnode->data = ele;
    newnode->next = head;
    head = newnode;
}

void pop(){
    struct node *temp = head;
    head = temp->next;
    free(temp);
}

void display(){
    struct node *temp = head;
    while(temp != NULL){
        printf("%d ", temp->data);
        temp = temp->next;
    }
}
```

## A Queue using Linked List

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. The first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be deleted from the queue.
A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list. When implemented using a linked list, the front of the queue is the head of the linked list and the rear of the queue is the last node of the linked list.

```c
struct node{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
} *front = NULL, *rear = NULL;

void enqueue(int x){
    struct node *t;
    t = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    if(t == NULL){
        printf("Queue is full\n");
    }else{
        t->data = x;
        t->next = NULL;
        if(front == NULL){
            front = rear = t;
        }else{
            rear->next = t;
            rear = t;
        }
    }
}

int dequeue(){
    int x = -1;
    struct node *t;
    if(front == NULL){
        printf("Queue is empty\n");
    }else{
        t = front;
        front = front->next;
        x = t->data;
        free(t);
    }
    return x;
}

void display(){
    struct node *p = front;
    while(p != NULL){
        printf("%d ", p->data);
        p = p->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

## Conclusion

Hence, these were some of the most common implementations of linked lists in C. Linked lists are a very important data structure and are used in many applications.
With that, thanks for reading, hope you have a great day!
