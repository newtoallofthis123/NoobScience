Binary search trees are a type of binary tree that satisfies the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Once all of these properties are satisfied, we can perform operations like searching, insertion, and deletion in O(log n) time.
Which is what makes them so useful.
Usually, we use binary search trees to store data that can be compared, like numbers or strings.

So, in this small jot, we'll be looking at implementing the following operations on a binary search tree:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Finding the minimum and maximum elements
- Finding the height of the tree

## Init

First, we'll need to define a node structure for our tree and write a function to create a new node.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node *left;
  struct node *right;
} *root = NULL;

struct node *getNode(int data)
{
  struct node *new_node = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  new_node->data = data;
  new_node->left = NULL;
  new_node->right = NULL;
  return new_node;
}
```

## Insertion

Insertion in a binary search tree is pretty straightforward.
We just need to traverse the tree until we find a node whose value is greater than the value we want to insert.
Then, we insert the new node as the left or right child of that node, depending on whether the value is lesser or greater than the node's value.

```c
struct node *insert(struct node *root, int data)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    root = getNode(data);
  }
  else if (data <= root->data)
  {
    root->left = insert(root->left, data);
  }
  else
  {
    root->right = insert(root->right, data);
  }
  return root;
}
```

## Deletion

Deletion is a bit more complicated than insertion.
We need to consider three cases:

- The node to be deleted is a leaf node (no children)
- The node to be deleted has one child
- The node to be deleted has two children

_A leaf node is a node that has no children._

```c
void delete(struct node *root, int data)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return;
  }
  else if (data < root->data)
  {
    delete (root->left, data);
  }
  else if (data > root->data)
  {
    delete (root->right, data);
  }
  else
  {
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL)
    {
      free(root);
      root = NULL;
    }
    else if (root->left == NULL)
    {
      struct node *temp = root;
      root = root->right;
      free(temp);
    }
    else if (root->right == NULL)
    {
      struct node *temp = root;
      root = root->left;
      free(temp);
    }
    else
    {
      struct node *temp = root->right;
      while (temp->left != NULL)
      {
        temp = temp->left;
      }
      root->data = temp->data;
      delete (root->right, temp->data);
    }
  }
}
```

## Searching

To search, we just need to traverse the tree until we find a node whose value is equal to the value we want to search for.

```c
int search(struct node *root, int data)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return 0;
  }
  else if (root->data == data)
  {
    return 1;
  }
  else if (data <= root->data)
  {
    return search(root->left, data);
  }
  else
  {
    return search(root->right, data);
  }
}
```

## Traversal

Traversal is the process of visiting each node in the tree exactly once.
There are three ways to traverse a tree:

- Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
- Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
- Postorder (Left, Right, Root)

```c
void displayInorder(struct node *root)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return;
  }
  displayInorder(root->left);
  printf("%d ", root->data);
  displayInorder(root->right);
}

void displayPreorder(struct node *root)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return;
  }
  printf("%d ", root->data);
  displayPreorder(root->left);
  displayPreorder(root->right);
}

void displayPostorder(struct node *root)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return;
  }
  displayPostorder(root->left);
  displayPostorder(root->right);
  printf("%d ", root->data);
}
```

## Level Order Traversal

Level order traversal is a bit different from the other three traversals.
It uses a queue to store the nodes of the tree.
We start by pushing the root node into the queue.
Then, we pop the front node from the queue and print its value.
Then, we push the left and right children of the node into the queue.

```c
void levelOrder(struct node *root){
  if(root == NULL){
    return;
  }
  struct node *queue[100];
  int front = -1, rear = -1;
  queue[++rear] = root;

  while(front != rear){
    struct node *current = queue[++front];
    printf("%d ", current->data);
    if(current->left != NULL){
        queue[++rear] = current->left;
    }
    if(current->right != NULL){
        queue[++rear] = current->right;
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding the minimum and maximum elements

The minimum element in a binary search tree is the leftmost node.
The maximum element in a binary search tree is the rightmost node.

```c
int min_ele(struct node *root)
{
  if (root->left == NULL)
  {
    return root->data;
  }
  min_ele(root->left);
}

int max_ele(struct node *root)
{
  if (root->right == NULL)
  {
    return root->data;
  }
  max_ele(root->right);
}
```

## Finding the height of the tree and the number of nodes

The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
To find the height of a tree, we need to find the height of the left and right subtrees and return the maximum of the two heights.
The number of nodes in a tree is the number of nodes in the left subtree plus the number of nodes in the right subtree plus one (for the root node).

```c
int getMax(int a, int b)
{
  return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

int getHeight(struct node *root)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return -1;
  }
  else
  {
    return (1 + getMax(getHeight(root->left), getHeight(root->right)));
  }
}

int countNodes(struct node *root)
{
  if (root == NULL)
  {
    return 0;
  }
  else
  {
    return (1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right));
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Hence, these were all the basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree.
Binary search trees are a very important data structure and are used in many applications.
The thing that makes them so useful is that they have a very fast search time.
The time complexity of searching in a binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
Hence, binary search trees are very useful when we need to search for elements in a sorted list.

With that being said, thank you for reading this quick jot on binary search trees. I hope you have a great day!
