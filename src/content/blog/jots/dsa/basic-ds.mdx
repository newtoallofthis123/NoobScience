Data structures are the building blocks of any program. They provide a way to store and organize data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate. 
In this post, we'll be looking at some basic data structures, implemented in C.

## Arrays

Arrays are a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
They are accessed using an index, which is an integer value that represents the position of the element in the array.
By nature, arrays are static, meaning that their size cannot be changed once they are declared.
Moreover, arrays are also homogenous, meaning that they can only store elements of the same type.

<small>Basic Array Operations</small>
```c
// Declaring an array
int arr[5];

// Initializing an array
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Accessing an array element
int x = arr[0];

// Changing an array element
arr[0] = 10;

// Iterating over an array
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
```

## Stacks

Stacks are a linear data structure that follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
Hence, imagine them as a stack of plates, where the last plate placed on the stack is the first one to be removed.
Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

<small>Basic Stack Operations</small>
```c
#define MAX 5

int top = -1;
int stack[5];

void push(int x) {
  if (top == MAX - 1) {
    printf("Stack Overflow\n");
    return;
  }
  stack[top] = x;
  top++;
}

void pop() {
  if (top == -1) {
    printf("Stack Underflow\n");
    return;
  }
  top--;
}

int peek() {
  if (top == -1) {
    printf("Stack Underflow\n");
    return -1;
  }
  return stack[top];
}

void print() {
  for (int i = 0; i <= top; i++) {
    printf("%d ", stack[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```

Stacks are used in many applications, such as:
- Function calls and recursion
- Undo/Redo operations
- Expression evaluation and conversion
- Backtracking algorithms

## Queues

Queues are a linear data structure that follow the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
Hence, imagine them as a queue of people waiting in line, where the first person to enter the queue is the first one to leave.
Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

<small>Basic Queue Operations</small>
```c
#define MAX 5

int front = -1;
int rear = -1;
int queue[5];

void enqueue(int ele){
  if (rear == MAX - 1) {
    printf("Queue Overflow\n");
    return;
  }
  if (front == -1) {
    front = 0;
  }
  rear++;
  queue[rear] = ele;
}

void dequeue() {
  if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
    printf("Queue Underflow\n");
    return;
  }
  front++;
}

int peek() {
  if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
    printf("Queue Underflow\n");
    return -1;
  }
  return queue[front];
}

void print() {
  for (int i = front; i <= rear; i++) {
    printf("%d ", queue[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```

Queues are used in many applications, such as:
- Scheduling algorithms
- CPU scheduling
- Disk scheduling

## Circular Queues

Circular queues are a variation of queues, where the last element is connected to the first element.
This allows us to use the space that is left empty after dequeueing an element.
Circular queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

<small>Basic Circular Queue Operations</small>
```c
#define MAX 5

int front = -1;
int rear = -1;
int queue[5];

int isEmpty(){
  if(front == -1 && rear == -1){
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

int isFull(){
  if((rear+1)%MAX == front){
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

void enqueue(int ele){
  if(isFull()){
    printf("Queue Overflow\n");
    return;
  }
  if(isEmpty()){
    front = 0;
  }
  rear = (rear+1)%MAX;
  queue[rear] = ele;
}

void dequeue(){
  if(isEmpty()){
    printf("Queue Underflow\n");
    return;
  }
  if(front == rear){
    front = -1;
    rear = -1;
  }
  else{
    front = (front+1)%MAX;
  }
}

int peek(){
  if(isEmpty()){
    printf("Queue Underflow\n");
    return -1;
  }
  return queue[front];
}

void print(){
  if(isEmpty()){
    printf("Queue Underflow\n");
    return;
  }
  for(int i = front; i != rear; i = (i+1)%MAX){
    printf("%d ", queue[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", queue[rear]);
}
```

## Conclusion

Data structures are an essential part of any program, and it is important to understand how they work.
In this post, we looked at some basic data structures, implemented in C.
The algorithms for these are all implemented using arrays, however, you can also do them in linked lists
that I will cover in a later blog post.

With that being said, thanks for reading, hope you have a great day.
