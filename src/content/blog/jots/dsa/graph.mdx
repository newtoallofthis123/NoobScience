Graphs are a data structure that are used to represent relationships between objects. They are made up of nodes and edges.
Nodes are the objects and edges are the relationships between them. Graphs are used to represent many real world things, such as social networks, maps, and more.

In C, graphs are usually implemented using adjacency lists. Adjacency lists are a list of lists, where each list represents the edges of a node. For example, if we have a graph with 3 nodes,
A, B, and C, and A is connected to B and C, then the adjacency list would look like this:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#define MAX 10
int G[MAX][MAX]={0,0};
void addEdge(int s,int d,int gt);
void printAdjMatrix(int v,int gtype);
int main()
{
    int v,e,s,d,i,gtype;
    scanf("%d",&gtype);
    scanf("%d",&v);
    scanf("%d",&e);
    for(i=1;i<=e;i++)
    {
      scanf("%d %d",&s,&d); 
      addEdge(s,d,gtype);
    }
   
    printAdjMatrix(v,gtype);
}

void addEdge(int s,int d,int gt)
{
    G[s][d]=1;
    if(gt==2)
    G[d][s]=1;
}

void printAdjMatrix(int v,int gtype)
{
 int i,j;
 if(gtype==1)
   printf("\nThe Adjacency Matrix for Directed Graph is :\n");
   else
    printf("\nThe Adjacency Matrix for Undirected Graph is :\n");
 for(i=1;i<=v;i++)
 {
      printf("\nVERTEX %d :  ",i);
     for(j=1;j<=v;j++)
     {
         printf("%d   ",G[i][j]);
     }
    
 }
}

```

## Traversals

Traversals are a way to visit every node in a graph. There are two main types of traversals: depth-first search and breadth-first search.

### Depth-First Search

Depth-first search is a traversal that starts at a node and visits all of its neighbors, then visits all of its neighbors' neighbors, and so on. It does this until it has visited every node in the graph.
DFS is implemented using a stack. The stack is used to keep track of which nodes to visit next. When a node is visited, it is pushed onto the stack. When a node is popped off the stack, it is visited.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#define MAX 10
void getgraph();
void DFS(int v);
int Visited[MAX]={0};
int G[MAX][MAX];
int n;
int main()
{
    int s,i;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    getgraph();
    scanf("%d",&s);
    printf("\nThe DFS Traversal of Graph is :\n");
    DFS(s);
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
    if(Visited[i]==0)
    DFS(i);
    } 
}
void DFS(int v)
{
int i;
Visited[v]=1;
printf("%d - ",v);
for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
 if((G[v][i]==1)&&(Visited[i]==0))
  DFS(i);
}
void getgraph()
{
  int i,j;
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        for(j=1;j<=n;j++)
        {
            scanf("%d",&G[i][j]);
        }
    }  
}
```

### Breadth-First Search

Breadth-first search is a traversal that starts at a node and visits all of its neighbors, then visits all of its neighbors' neighbors, and so on. It does this until it has visited every node in the graph.
BFS is implemented using a queue. The queue is used to keep track of which nodes to visit next. When a node is visited, it is added to the queue. When a node is removed from the queue, it is visited.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#define MAX 15
void getAdjMatrix();//read a graph
void BFS(int v);
int dequeue();
void enqueue(int v);
int Visited[MAX]={0};
int G[MAX][MAX];
int Q[MAX];
int n,r=-1,f=-1;
int main()
{
    int s,i;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    getAdjMatrix();
    scanf("%d",&s);
    printf("\nThe BFS Traversal of Graph is : ");    
    BFS(s);
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
    if(Visited[i]==0)
    BFS(i);
    } 
}
void BFS(int v)
{
int i,res;
Visited[v]=1;
enqueue(v);
while(f!=-1)
{
   res=dequeue();
   printf("%d ",res);
   for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
   {
       if(G[res][i]==1&&Visited[i]==0)
       {
           enqueue(i);
           Visited[i]=1;
       }
   }
 }
}
int dequeue()
{
    int ver;
    if(f==-1)
    {
        printf("\n Q Underflow");
        return -1;
    }
    ver=Q[f];
    if(r==f)
    r=f=-1;
    else
    f++;
    return(ver);
}
void enqueue(int v)
{
  if(r==MAX-1)
    {
        printf("\n Q Overflow");
        return;
    }  
    Q[++r]=v;
    if(r==0)
    f=0;
}

void getAdjMatrix()
{
  int i,j;
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        for(j=1;j<=n;j++)
        {
            scanf("%d",&G[i][j]);
        }
    }  
}
```
