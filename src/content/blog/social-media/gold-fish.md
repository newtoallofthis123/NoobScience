Ever seen a gold fish? Beautiful creatures aren't they? There's something in the
way they move, something in the way they do it (Hey Ellie Goulding), that makes
them so mesmerizing. In the time when you were looking at the gold fish, the gold
fish might have already seen you, felt hungry, tried to eat something, and then
swam away. That's how short their attention span is. 9 seconds. That's all it takes
for them to forget what they were doing and move on to something else.

Now, hey there once more. If you survived reading the last paragraph, congrats!
You have a longer attention span than a gold fish. But, that's not saying much.
Now, I will stop with the gold fish analogy, mostly because I am quoting off
a study conducted by Microsoft Advertising, not the most unbiased source.
The now famous study, conducted in 2015, concluded that the average attention
span of a human being is 8 seconds. That's 1 second less than a gold fish.
All published in a report titled ["Attention Spans"](https://dl.motamem.org/microsoft-attention-spans-research-report.pdf), the study has been
quoted by many, and has been used to justify the shortening of content on many
platforms.

Now, I am not here to dispute or justify the study. I am here to talk about
about the more general idea of attention spans, how they are changing, and
what it means for us.

## Some History

Your attention span is the amount of time you can focus on something without
getting distracted. Now, by distraction, I mean the whole spectrum from
getting bored to sleeping. Basically, your attention span is your concentration.
So, now, your concentration getting shorter doesn't seem like a good thing, doesn't it.

Now, it is not like our attention spans are fixed for our life. It is not like a stat for our
character in a video game.
It is something that can be trained and improved. Through out out life, our attention span
keeps on changing.
For example, maybe a 22 year old can sit for a 3 hour lecture, but a 12 year old can't.
So, our attention span is not always the same. It changes with age, and it changes with time.
It however, may also change with other factors, like our health, our mental state, and
our environment. Now, the first two are beyond this article, but the third one is what I want to talk about.

Our environment is changing. We are living in a world where we are constantly bombarded with information and
are more connected than ever.
With all of this however, came the social media giants. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, and
many more. These platforms have changed the way we consume content. They have changed the way we interact with
each other and a lot more things that are fundamental to the human experience.
Now, for better for for worse is up to debate, but one thing is for sure, they have changed _the way_ and _the type_
of content we consume.

During the early days of the internet, the content was mostly text based. Long form content was the norm.
People used to spend hours reading articles and blogs, news sites were the most popular, and people used to
folk to the latest internet forums to discuss their favorite topics.

With the advent of social media too, content was still mostly text based. People used to post their thoughts,
their opinions, and their ideas. However, a new form of content was also emerging. The image. Now I believe
images changed the way we consume and build the internet. It was the first time we could see something on the
internet that was not text and people were hooked. We had photos, memes, and a lot more. Software like photoshop
came into play and stuff like Adobe Flash was used to create animations. The internet was changing.

Now, let's zoom into around the time when YouTube was launched. Now videos on the internet was not a new thing.
People had been uploading videos on the internet for a long time. However, YouTube changed the game. It was
the first time where people had a platform and a nice CDN to upload their videos. They had a community they can
interact with and all the cool stuff that comes with it. In the early days, most YouTube content was unregulated and 
it was mostly just people uploading the most random stuff. However, as time went on, people and the company
started to realize the potential of the platform. Google soon acquired YouTube and the rest is history.

## What is happening now?

Enter TikTok. Now, I am not going to talk about TikTok in detail, but I will say that it is the first platform
that was truly video and mobile first. It was as if TikTok took all the things that got people hooked to the 
internet in the first place and basically magnified it. You had short and snappy videos, a easy to operate interface, a
very addictive algorithm and basically anything that would _never_ let you get off the app.

Now, I am not saying that TikTok is the only reason why our attention spans are getting shorter. I am just saying
that gave rise to the culture of __bombarding__ your users with content that they would not normally consume otherwise.
It gave rise to the culture of __short__ and __snappy__ content. To engage your users, you no longer had to make
nice, long, and informative content. You just had to make them __feel__ something. Now, it can be anything, ranging from 
anger and dismay to happiness and joy. So, the whole narrative of the internet changed.
It shifted from consuming to __feeling__.

> "The internet shifted from consuming content to feeling from it."

This can also be reflected in society as a whole. This is because social media is after all a reflection of society.
We are living in a world where people are more polarized than ever and it is not a good thing. Woah! Let's not get
political here.

I want you to question one more thing. Let's say you are doing a rather mundane task, like climbing the stairs or 
maybe eating (yes, I know I just called eating mundane). What do you do? You take out your phone and start scrolling.
You scroll basically anything, from Instagram to Reddit. You consume more content than food.
Now, this culture is something that's problematic. Scrolling is not good for our dopamine levels at all and it
is definitely not good for our attention spans.

Now, I am not part of the whole "dopamin buff" culture. I am not saying that dopamine is bad. I am just saying
that the way we get it is bad. We are getting dopamine from the wrong means and the social media giants are
well aware of it. They are using it to their advantage and we are the ones who are suffering.
