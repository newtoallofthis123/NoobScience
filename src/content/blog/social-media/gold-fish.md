Ever seen a gold fish? Beautiful creatures aren't they? There's something in the
way they move, something in the way they do it (Hey Ellie Goulding), that makes
them so mesmerizing. In the time when you were looking at the gold fish, the gold
fish might have already seen you, felt hungry, tried to eat something, and then
swam away. That's how short their attention span is. 9 seconds. That's all it takes
for them to forget what they were doing and move on to something else.

Now, hey there once more. If you survived reading the last paragraph, congrats!
You have a longer attention span than a gold fish. But, that's not saying much.
Now, I will stop with the gold fish analogy, mostly because I am quoting off
a study conducted by Microsoft Advertising, not the most unbiased source.
The now famous study, conducted in 2015, concluded that the average attention
span of a human being is 8 seconds. That's 1 second less than a gold fish.
All published in a report titled ["Attention Spans"](https://dl.motamem.org/microsoft-attention-spans-research-report.pdf), the study has been
quoted by many, and has been used to justify the shortening of content on many
platforms.

Now, I am not here to dispute or justify the study. I am here to talk about
about the more general idea of attention spans, how they are changing, and
what it means for us.

## What is happening?

Your attention span is the amount of time you can focus on something without
getting distracted. Now, by distraction, I mean the whole spectrum from
getting bored to sleeping. Basically, your attention span is your concentration.
So, now, your concentration getting shorter doesn't seem like a good thing, doesn't it.

Now, it is not like our attention spans are fixed for our life. It is not like a stat for our character in a video game.
It is something that can be trained and improved. Through out out life, our attention span keeps on changing.
For example, maybe a 22 year old can sit for a 3 hour lecture, but a 12 year old can't.
So, our attention span is not always the same. It changes with age, and it changes with time.
It however, may also change with other factors, like our health, our mental state, and our environment. Now, the first two are beyond this article, but the third one is what I want to talk about.

Our environment is changing. We are living in a world where we are constantly bombarded with information and are more connected than ever. All of humanity is on our
