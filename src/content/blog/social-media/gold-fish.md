Ever seen a gold fish? Beautiful creatures aren't they? There's something in the
way they move, something in the way they do it (Hey Ellie Goulding), that makes
them so mesmerizing. In the time when you were looking at the gold fish, the gold
fish might have already seen you, felt hungry, tried to eat something, and then
swam away. That's how short their attention span is. 9 seconds. That's all it takes
for them to forget what they were doing and move on to something else.
