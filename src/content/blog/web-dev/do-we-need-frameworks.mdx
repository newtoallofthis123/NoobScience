Hey quick, I have a small job for you. I want you to quickly build a website
that fetches data from only a _single endpoint_ that I will provide and
just display the information on the page. You have 2 hours. Go!. Oh! and
you cannot use _anything_. No frameworks, no libraries, no nothing. Just
plain old vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. Oh and you cannot use any CSS or JS
pre-processors either. You have to write everything from scratch. Go!

Yes I can't do it either, so don't beat yourself up.
So, let's explore the question, do we really need frameworks
## What is a framework?

A framework is a collection of libraries that are bundled together to
provide a set of tools to make it easier to build applications.
Frameworks are usually opinionated and have a set of rules that you have
to follow to use them. They are usually built to solve a specific problem
that is common in a lot of applications. Usually open source, frameworks
are maintained by a community of developers and are usually free to use.

Liked the CoPilot Answer? Now Listen to a human ;)

### What is a library?

First, to understand frameworks, you will have to understand libraries.
Libraries are a collection of functions that you can use to solve a
specific problem. For example, if you want to make an HTTP request to a
server, you can use the `fetch` function that is provided by the browser.
Now, what if you want to make a request to a server that is not on the
same domain as your website? You will have to use the `XMLHttpRequest`
object. Basically you will have to write a lot of code to make a simple
request that handles all the edge cases. This is where libraries come in.

You might have heard of libraries like `axios` or `superagent`. These
libraries are built on top of the `XMLHttpRequest` object and provide a
simpler interface to make HTTP requests. They also handle all the edge
cases for you. So, you can just use the library and not worry about
anything else.

Why not just write it yourself? Well, happy weekend! You can write it
yourself, but why reinvent the wheel? You can just use the library and
save yourself a lot of time and effort.

So, libs are a huge plus to believers of the DRY(Donot Repeat YourSelf) principle. But, what
about frameworks?

### Summation of libraries

Frameworks are a collection of libraries that are bundled together and abstracted
away from the developer. 
So, her's how I like to think of frameworks. Imagine you are a chef and you have to
make a dish. You have to make a lot of things from scratch. You have to make the
sauce, the bread, the cheese, the whole thing. Now, imagine you have a sous chef
who makes all the things for you and you just have to assemble them. That's what
frameworks are. They are a collection of libraries that are bundled together and
abstracted away from the developer. So, you don't have to worry about the
underlying libraries and you can just focus on building your application.

Most importantly, frameworks abstract away the necessary configurations that enable 
libraries to work together. For example, if you want to use `react` and `webpack` together,
you will have to configure `webpack` to work with `react`. This is a lot of work and
can be a huge pain. Frameworks like `create-react-app` abstract away all the necessary
configurations and provide you with a boilerplate that you can use to build your
application.

So, to understand them better, let's look at a rather famous framework, `next.js`.

## Next.js: An Example

React likes to think of itself as more of a library than a framework.
This is because, while React is usually used in a certain way, it doesn't
force you to use it in that way. You can use React in any way you want.
You can use it with webpack or rollup or even without a
bundler. You can have state management and auth and routing and all the
other things that you need to build an application. But, you will have
not be forced to use them. You can use them if you want to.

The choice is not the problem here. The problem is that you have to
configure all these things yourself. You have to configure webpack to
work well with redux and react-router and react. You have to
configure babel to work with react. 
It's a whole thing. If you are a beginner, just try to successfully make a 
react app without `create-react-app` or `vite` and you'll come to 
appreciate the work that these frameworks do.

This is where frameworks like `next.js` come in. They abstract away all
the necessary configurations and provide you with a boilerplate that you
can use to build your application. So, you don't have to worry about
configuring webpack or babel or anything else. You can just focus on
building your application.

Next.js also introduces the most important feature of a framework, the
routing system. Next.js provides a inbuilt file based routing system
that you can use to build your application. This is a huge plus for
beginners as they don't have to worry about configuring a routing
library. You also get the `<Link />` component that you can use to
navigate between pages, without having to worry about the underlying
caching mechanism.
Next.js also provides a lot of other features like server side rendering
and static site generation that you can use to build your application.
It is basically a eco system that you can use to build your application.

So, you can see the appeal of a framework. It abstracts away everything.
In a previous article, I talked about the dangers of abstraction. But,
frameworks are a different beast altogether.

### JS Bundle üí∞

This site is written in Astro, a new static site generator that supports the 
island architecture. This means that I can use any framework or library that I want
to build this site. I can use React or Vue or Svelte or even plain old vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
It is a very powerful feature and I am very excited to see where it goes.

However, if you are using a framework like Next.js, you will have to use React.
React by default, loads the entire library into the browser. This is a huge problem
as it increases the bundle size of your application. 
Bundle sizes have reduced significantly over the years, but they are still a problem.
For example, my next.js version of this site is 1.5MB. For contrast, my Astro version
of this site is 200KB. That's a huge difference for a site that is just a blog.

For a fast and SEO optimized Next.js site, you will have to make a lot of changes.
You will have to use `next/image` instead of `img` tags. You should have to render 
the page on the server side and send it to the client. It's a whole thing.
Luckily, Next.js provides a lot of features that help you with these.

The recent versions of Next.js ship react server side rendered by default. This is a huge
win for Next.js as it helps you build fast and SEO optimized sites.
I discuss more about this in my article on the same topic.

However, in my humble opinion, Multi Page Applications and Single Page Applications
are not in the same league. They are two different things and should be treated as such.
Let me explain.

### MPA's and SPA's

Multi Page Applications are applications that have multiple pages. Each page is a separate
HTML file. When you click on a link, the browser makes a request to the server and the server
sends the HTML file for that page. This is the traditional way of building websites.

Single Page applications on the other hand, are applications that have only one HTML file.
When you click on a link, the browser doesn't make a request to the server. Instead, it
renders the page on the client side. This is the modern way of building websites.
The most popular SPA framework is React. React uses a virtual dom to keep a track of the
changes in the application. When a user clicks on a link, React renders the page on the
client side and updates the virtual dom. This makes the experience more app like and natural.

## Do we need frameworks?

Now, let's get to the question at hand. Do we really need frameworks?
Well, the answer is, it depends. 
I know that it is a very unsatisfying answer, but it is the truth.
Cliched developer answer for a cliched developer question.

![Answer to everything](https://i.redd.it/go1w28pv487a1.png)

Frameworks are a huge plus for beginners. They help you get started
and build applications fast and efficiently. You don't need to get scared and
worry about conditional rendering and state management and all the other things,
you just need to create a `about.tsx` file and start writing your code.

### Where are they useful?

Let me give you an example. Let's say you are an indie hacker and you want to build a
small sass application. You might build the actual application using JAMStack and
a good DataBase, but you will need a UI to interact with the database. You can use
a framework like Next.js to build the UI. It will help you get started fast and
you can build a MVP in a few days. 

Using a framework like Next.js would also give you an amazing community of developers
that work on plugins, libraries and other things that you can use to build your application.
You can fully use the power of the react.dev ecosystem and build your application.

One more scenario. Imagine me building this very site you are reading. This site has a 
dynamic updates section that is linked to a mongoDB database. I use typescript bindings to interact
with it using [Astro.js](https://astro.build), a MPA framework. My blog is less than 8000
lines of code and I have a fully functional blog with a dynamic updates section and a url shortener.
I could have built this site using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, but it would have taken me a lot of time
and a lot of boilerplate. Thing is, I tried to make it work like that. However, once my 
amount of posts increased, I had to switch to a framework. I could have used a library like

### Stability

A framework provides stability. You might have heard of create app cli's like `create-t3-app` and `create-react-app`.
These cli's provide you with a boilerplate that you can use to build your application with industry standard
configurations.
All this might seem benign at start, but overtime, seconds add up to minutes and minutes add up to hours.
And overall, you will save a lot of time and effort.

### Developer Experience

You are most likely to have a better developer experience with a framework. Frameworks provide you with
a set of rules that you have to work with. You know the good thing about having rules? Others have the same rules.
So, if you on board a new developer, you don't have to worry about teaching them the rules. They already know them.
Atleast you can assume that they know them. 

This is because by nature, these frameworks are opinionated.
Hence, you don't need to worry about having internal documentation for your application. You can just
use the documentation of the framework.

## Conclusion

So, I have given you all the arguments and now it's time for you to decide. Do you need a framework?
Thing is, you probably do. You might not need it now, but you will need it in the future.
However, if you are a beginner, I would suggest you to try to build a small application without a framework.
Just try to get the hang of it. It will help you understand the underlying concepts and you will be able to
appreciate the work that these frameworks do.

So, the thing I am getting to is that while you should work with frameworks, know and appreciate the 
underlying concepts. It will help in the long run.

With that said, I hope you liked this article. If you did, please consider sharing it with your friends.
It would mean a lot to me. Also, if you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know in the comments.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
