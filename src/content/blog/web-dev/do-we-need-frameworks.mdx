Hey quick, I have a small job for you. I want you to quickly build a website
that fetches data from only a _single endpoint_ that I will provide and
just display the information on the page. You have 2 hours. Go!. Oh! and
you cannot use _anything_. No frameworks, no libraries, no nothing. Just
plain old vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. Oh and you cannot use any CSS or JS
pre-processors either. You have to write everything from scratch. Go!

Yes I can't do it either, so don't beat yourself up.
So, let's explore the question, do we really need frameworks or are they
just as useful as a salt shaker in the ocean and then finally, we'll try to 
replicate this article using only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

## What is a framework?

A framework is a collection of libraries that are bundled together to
provide a set of tools to make it easier to build applications.
Frameworks are usually opinionated and have a set of rules that you have
to follow to use them. They are usually built to solve a specific problem
that is common in a lot of applications. Usually open source, frameworks
are maintained by a community of developers and are usually free to use.

Liked the CoPilot Answer? Now Listen to a human ;)

### What is a library?

First, to understand frameworks, you will have to understand libraries.
Libraries are a collection of functions that you can use to solve a
specific problem. For example, if you want to make an HTTP request to a
server, you can use the `fetch` function that is provided by the browser.
Now, what if you want to make a request to a server that is not on the
same domain as your website? You will have to use the `XMLHttpRequest`
object. Basically you will have to write a lot of code to make a simple
request that handles all the edge cases. This is where libraries come in.

You might have heard of libraries like `axios` or `superagent`. These
libraries are built on top of the `XMLHttpRequest` object and provide a
simpler interface to make HTTP requests. They also handle all the edge
cases for you. So, you can just use the library and not worry about
anything else.

Why not just write it yourself? Well, happy weekend! You can write it
yourself, but why reinvent the wheel? You can just use the library and
save yourself a lot of time and effort.

So, libs are a huge plus to believers of the DRY(Donot Repeat YourSelf) principle. But, what
about frameworks?

### Summation of libraries

Frameworks are a collection of libraries that are bundled together and abstracted
away from the developer. 
So, her's how I like to think of frameworks. Imagine you are a chef and you have to
make a dish. You have to make a lot of things from scratch. You have to make the
sauce, the bread, the cheese, the whole thing. Now, imagine you have a sous chef
who makes all the things for you and you just have to assemble them. That's what
frameworks are. They are a collection of libraries that are bundled together and
abstracted away from the developer. So, you don't have to worry about the
underlying libraries and you can just focus on building your application.

Most importantly, frameworks abstract away the necessary configurations that enable 
libraries to work together. For example, if you want to use `react` and `webpack` together,
you will have to configure `webpack` to work with `react`. This is a lot of work and
can be a huge pain. Frameworks like `create-react-app` abstract away all the necessary
configurations and provide you with a boilerplate that you can use to build your
application.

So, to understand them better, let's look at a rather famous framework, `next.js`.

## Next.js: An Example

React likes to think of itself as more of a library than a framework.
This is because, while React is usually used in a certain way, it doesn't
force you to use it in that way. You can use React in any way you want.
You can use it with webpack or rollup or even without a
bundler. You can have state management and auth and routing and all the
other things that you need to build an application. But, you will have
not be forced to use them. You can use them if you want to.

The choice is not the problem here. The problem is that you have to
configure all these things yourself. You have to configure webpack to
work well with redux and react-router and react. You have to
configure babel to work with react. 
It's a whole thing. If you are a beginner, just try to successfully make a 
react app without `create-react-app` or `vite` and you'll come to 
appreciate the work that these frameworks do.

This is where frameworks like `next.js` come in. They abstract away all
the necessary configurations and provide you with a boilerplate that you
can use to build your application. So, you don't have to worry about
configuring webpack or babel or anything else. You can just focus on
building your application.

Next.js also introduces the most important feature of a framework, the
routing system. Next.js provides a inbuilt file based routing system
that you can use to build your application. This is a huge plus for
beginners as they don't have to worry about configuring a routing
library. You also get the `<Link />` component that you can use to
navigate between pages, without having to worry about the underlying
caching mechanism.
