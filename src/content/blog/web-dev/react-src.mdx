On the 4th of May 2023, Next.js, the popular server framework for the ever green React Framework announced an update to 
their version `v.13.4`. In a rather detailed blog post, published on [vercel's blog](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4), they
go into the depth of the released and the controversial introduction of the next.js app router that has out of the box react server components, 
instead of the traditional client components in the `/pages` directory. Now, to be precise, the previous pages routers were not technically 

## What are RSC?

React server components are a new way of writing react components that are rendered on the server. So, in a sense, we
reduce the amount of javascript that is sent to the client, and instead, we send the HTML that is rendered on the server.
What I said here is a very brief abstract of what react server components actually are. Their's working is quite complex
and it has taken the react team a lot of brilliant minds to make RSC's a reality.

The actual RSC's were introduced way back in react 18, but were only recently popularized due to next.js
making them their default experience. Now, just to make it very clear, the pages routes will still be supported and
supported for the for seeable future according to the next.js team. However, they want us to slowly, but surely make the 
migration to React Server Components.

I am not an expert in the react ecosystem nor have I ever contributed to React or Next.js projects, 
hence, I cannot delve into the inner workings of the system and how you should incrementally migrate.
For that, next.js has a great [blog post](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) that I recommend
you definitely check out.

## Why is it a big deal?

React server components don't seem like such a big deal at this point right? I mean, they are still "React" right?

Now, this is where the controversy really happened in my opinion. React Server Components, along with the migration to the next.js app routes, 
significant change the "React" way to do things. Here's a small example and by small I mean the most important issue.
We are all familiar with the React Tree right? The whole fiasco where a javascript bundle is first sent that renders and hydrates the document.
It's a whole thing, and if you are new to that, I highly recommend you do some digging on the topic.
Now let's see that has changed. 

Given below is a good illustration by [gaearon](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/4) about the differences 
between React Server Components and the old React Client Components

I hope you were able to see the main problem with React Server Components. Yep. There is not client.
So, essentially, we lose all the "reactivity" we get from React all together. So, in React Server Components, there 
are no React Hooks, no `useState`, no `useEffect`. Everything is rendered on the server and incrementally 
hydrated on the client side. As I said, it's a whole thing.

So, this is where the next.js `app/` router comes up with a bunch of solutions for this.
Here's what they decided to structure the whole thing around RSC's.
Before you go on twitter and start ranting, normal react components are still there.
To convert a RSC to a client component, you simply use the `'use client'` directive at the 
top and you are done. Welcome back client!

```tsx
'use client'

import React from 'react'

export default function ReactComponent({}: {}) {
  return (
    <div>ReactComponent</div>
  )
}
```

Well, this is far from ideal, but it is not the worst. Now, before you react guys react and label me a negative guy, 
just know I was only talking about the negatives. So, with that said.

## RSC's are cool. Right?

With all this being said, React Server Components, and by extension, the next.js `app/` router is
very cool. Remember the times where you had to like create a hundred `/api` endpoints to get anything
significant done in a next.js web app? Say good bye to your `/api` endpoint. You don't need it anymore.
Since with RSC's you can the ability to call server functions from the React Component itself!
Yes! So this means, you can do all sorts of cool stuff like query your database, login your users, check the 
store and the whole thing.

The way to do all of this is also quite simple. You just define the React Component as an async function. Yes! It is that simple.
In an async react function, you have access to the javascript Promises API which in turn gives you access to the server.
So, for example:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type Props = {}

export default async function ReactAsyncComponent({}: Props) {
  const data = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5500/login")
  return (
    <div>
        {data}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Hence, you can use your provider's edge functions from your React Component natively, without
the need to define an `/api` route for that little thing.

Next thing is the layout and page structure of the app directory. I will try and explain the basics, however, 
I recommend you check out the official [next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure) for a more
detailed explanation.

This is how a typical next.js app route looks after 13.4

![Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ffile-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_3t45xqvdFH5e2mbpGav32WgPREEq)

If you can probably guess, the layout.tsx is based on hierarchy, so in the sense, you can stack layouts up.
So, you can have a global layout where you can define all of your styles and stuff, then have a intermediate layout that
handles authentication and all that. It is honestly quite cool what people have already done with this.

Moreover, all the data handling is now done by next.js natively. So, you have a loading skelton defined as `loading.tsx` and you have a 
data not found page, along with an `error.tsx` file for handling error.

So, to summarize all of this, you no longer need to write complex, but small old cookie cutter logic to fetch data from your api, 
or do anything server related in next.js. You no longer need to use `getStaticProps` and all that preprocessing stuff that usually used to slow down 
the initial page hydration. So, forget `swr` and all that stuff you would have needed to configure to have a stable app to api config.
Your API request loads just once when the page is rendered, keyword here being rendered not hydrated.

As you can quite clearly see, React Server Components make the whole next.js experience a lot more streamlined and a lot more
data driven. You can now focus on the actual app logic and not worry about the data fetching and all that stuff.
If that line sounded like corporate talk, it is because it is and the only reason I used it is because it quite succinctly 
explains the whole thing.

Moreover, the change is not really that paradigm shifting. It is just a change in the way we write our components.
You can still use the old client components, all you need to do is add the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file.
As easy as that. All the react hooks and the old react libraries still work A OK. So, you don't need to worry about that.

What really is the problem then?

## The problem

Now, know that I am not like a next.js expert or anything, but I have been using next.js for a while now and I have
a pretty good idea of how it works. So, I will try and explain the problem as best as I can.

The problem is not with the React Server Components themselves. They are a great addition to the React ecosystem and
have a lot of potential.
The problem people have is with the next.js `app/` router. The problem is that it is a significant change to the way
we write our next.js apps and by extension, our react apps.
Most people argue that it is too much of a change and that it is not worth it.

Now the next.js team has been very clear about this. They are not forcing anyone to use the `app/` router. They are
merely making this exciting new feature the default experience. So, you can still use your old next.js app routes
and your old client components. They are not going anywhere. However, the next.js team has made it very clear that
they want to move to React Server Components and the `app/` router in the future. So, it is not a matter of if, but
when. 

In my _personal opinion_, I think the next.js team is hinting at slowly deprecating the old next.js app routes and
switching to the new `app/` router. Now I think they have a good reason for this that I will explain later on in the
article. However, to give credit where credit is due, the next.js team has been doing a fantastic job of listening to
the community and taking feedback and also just being responsive and transparent about the whole thing. So, props to 
them for that.

Let's now get into the nitty gritty of the problem. The problem is that the next.js `app/` router is a significant change
to the "react way" of doing things.
So, the most basic of "react things" have been changed. For example, if you needed a form in your react app, you would
have to use the `useState` hook to manage the state of the form. However, in the next.js `app/` router, you can't do that.
You would have to use the `e.currentTarget.value` to get the value of the input. Now, this is not a big deal, but when you zoom 
out and look at the whole picture, you can see that the next.js `app/` router is not as easy to migrate to as the next.js team
would like you to believe.

```tsx
// Old way

import React, { useState } from 'react'

export default function ReactComponent({}: {}) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("")

  return (
    <div>
        <input 
        type="text" 
        value={value} 
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.currentTarget.value)} 
        />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// New way

import React from 'react'

type Props = {}

async function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(e.name.value)
}

export default async function ReactComponent({}: Props) {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input name="name" type="text" />
    </form>
  )
}

```

You would have to change some of the most fundamental workings of your components, which when you think about it, is a lot of work and money.
Remember next.js is not just used for portfolio websites. It is used for large scale enterprise applications that have a lot of
moving parts and complex business logic. Let's just say you have a hard time convincing your boss to migrate to the next.js `app/` router.

## Recommendations

As always in my dev stories, I would not like to leave you with the definitive answer to the problem, mostly because I don't know myself.
However, here are some of my recommendations on how to go about this if you are a next.js dev.

1. **Don't panic** - The next.js team has made it very clear that they are not forcing anyone to use the `app/` router. They are merely
making it the default experience. So, you can still use your old next.js app routes and your old client components. They are not going anywhere.

2. **Get a Scale** - See how complex your app is. If it is a simple portfolio website, then you can probably migrate to the `app/` router
without much hassle. However, if you are working on a large scale enterprise application, then you might want to wait a bit and see how the
next.js `app/` router evolves and mostly how the community reacts to it.

3. **Check core dependencies** - If you are using a lot of third party libraries, then you might want to check if they are compatible with
the next.js `app/` router. If they are not, then you might want to wait a bit. Many of javascript libraries are open source and are maintained
by independent developers. So, it might take a while for them to migrate to the new `app/` router. So, you might want to wait a bit before you end up
with a half baked app.

4. **Start small** - If you are still adamant on migrating to the `app/` router, then I recommend you start small. Start with a small component
that is not too complex and doesn't use _any_ third party libraries. Then, slowly, but surely, migrate to the `app/` router. This way, you can 
follow the next.js team's advice and incrementally migrate to the `app/` router.
You might mark this method as "next.js approved". Good starting points are maybe your `/about` page or your footer component.

5. **Make a plan** - If you are still adamant on migrating to the `app/` router, then I recommend you make a plan. Start by first having a clear 
understanding of your component tree and your layout structure. Then, start by migrating the most basic components and then slowly move up the
hierarchy. This way, you can immediately see if something is not working and you can fix it before it becomes a problem.
Make sure you use the next.js `app/` router docs as a reference. They are quite good and have a lot of examples.

6. **Don't Switch** - If you are a large scale enterprise application, then I recommend you don't switch to the `app/` router. The next.js team
is still working on a lot of things and the best is yet to come. So, I recommend you wait a bit and see how the next.js `app/` router evolves.
Moreover, the next.js team has made it very clear that they are not forcing anyone to use the `app/` router. Hence, I am pretty 
sure that for the for seeable future, at least for enterprise applications, the next.js page routes will be supported.

7. **Don't just use `'use client'`** - If you are migrating to the `app/` router, then I recommend you don't just use the `'use client'` directive
to each and every one of your react client components. Trust me I did that and it is not fun. I basically had to _rewrite_ all of my components.
So, I recommend you use the `'use client'` directive only for the components you know need it. For example, your responsive navbar component might
need it, but your contact component might not. So, use it only where you need it. Then again, planning (point 5) is key here.

8. **Ask for help to _people_** - If you encounter any problems, then I recommend you ask for help from the community. The next.js team has been
very responsive and transparent about the whole thing. I know asking chatGPT sounds way easier, but remember, this is a new technology and it is
still not very well documented. So, I recommend you ask for help from the community. They are very helpful and will help you out.
Some useful places are given down in the resources section.

## Conclusion

Now, I for one have every less applications written in next.js. I have a few small scale applications that I am leaving as is.
I tried migrating my v.3 site to the `app/` router before I made the [shift to astro](/e/🌏) and it was not the best.
As I pointed out in point 7 of the recommendations, I basically just used the `'use client'` directive to all of my components and
it made the whole thing a lot more complex than it needed to be. So, I recommend you don't do that.
Rewrite all of the components that need to be rewritten and then use the `'use client'` directive only where you need it.
However, all the projects of mine that I am working on right now are all using the `app/` router and I am loving it.
I think I am slowly getting the hang of it and I am starting to see the benefits of the `app/` router.
So, I recommend you try it out and see if it works for you. If it doesn't, then you can always switch back to the old next.js app routes.
However, eventually, you will have to migrate to the `app/` router. So, I recommend you start small and start early, if you are a small scale
application. If you are a large scale enterprise application, then I recommend you wait a bit and see how the next.js `app/` router evolves.
There are a lot of exciting things coming up and I am sure the next.js team will make the migration process a lot easier.

In my personal opinion, React Server Components are a great addition to the React ecosystem. They have a lot of potential and
I am excited to see where the react team takes it. However, it needs to be acknowledged that the next.js `app/` router is a significant
change to the way we write our next.js apps and even though the next.js team has been quite helpful and transparent about the whole thing,
there needs to be more well written documentation and examples on how to migrate to the `app/` router.

I for one have to give kudos to the supabase team for their [supabase](https://supabase.io/docs) docs. They didn't take 
long to rewrite most of their documentation and examples to the new `app/` router. So, props to them for that.

With that being said, I hope you enjoyed this dev story. I know it was a bit long, but I hope you got something out of it.
Have any questions or suggestions? Feel free to reach out to me on my [contact page](/contact). Would love to hear from you.
Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
