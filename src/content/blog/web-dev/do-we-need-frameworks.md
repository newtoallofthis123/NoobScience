Hey quick, I have a small job for you. I want you to quickly build a website
that fetches data from only a _single endpoint_ that I will provide and
just display the information on the page. You have 2 hours. Go!. Oh! and
you cannot use _anything_. No frameworks, no libraries, no nothing. Just
plain old vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. Oh and you cannot use any CSS or JS
pre-processors either. You have to write everything from scratch. Go!

Yes I can't do it either, so don't beat yourself up.
