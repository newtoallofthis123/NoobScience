Well this blog is quite old at this point. Almost a like 6 months old. 
I really love blogging and writing about my experiences and thoughts.
However, recently I have been reading a lot of blogs by other _amazing_ developers and a lot of pondering and observation led me to some glaring 
issues with my blog. Here are some I feel comfortable sharing:

1. I share either too much or too little. I either write a 1000 word essay or a 100 word essay. I need to find a middle ground.
2. My thoughts are not backed by the right amount of research. I need to do more research before I write a blog post.
3. Blogs seem to get repetitive. I need to find a way to make my blog posts more interesting and unique.
4. Quality over quantity.
5. Authenticity and originality.

Some of the issues are a bit dramatized, but I still think it is important for me to address them.
So, here are my ideas and changes I plan/made to make my blog better

## Stop Redesigning (Too Much)

I have a habit of redesigning my blog every few weeks. This was awesome when I was learning a lot of web development, but now that I feel 
a bit well established in the field, I think it is time to stop redesigning my blog, it has sort of reached it's theoretical peak.
Not to say that it is perfect. Nothing is _perfect_ and that is the beauty of it. I will still make changes to the blog, but they will be
less frequent, more subtle and more meaningful.

This also plays a bit into my overall self esteem. I think that it is very easy to compare yourself to others in the field and feel like what you build is not good enough.
I have to change this mindset and focus on my own work and not compare it to others. I have to be proud of what I build.
So no more #inspiration rewrites. Enough of that. I have better (rusty) things to do.

## Quality over Quantity

My blog posts don't usually get a lot of attention. However, I just hit 700 followers on `dev.to` and I was very happy about that.
However, this also made me realize that I need to focus on quality over quantity. I need to write more meaningful posts that people will actually read.
Most of my blog posts are written almost on a whim with previous research and analysis. I do make sure that the info I share is correct, but I don't do enough research.

I must be careful about what I write. I cannot be the source of misinformation and I'll have to make sure that I am not spreading any misinformation.

To solve this, I came up with a whole notion planner that I will be following for each and every one of my blog posts. I also implemented components that would help me
add foot notes and citations to my blog posts. I also added a `Sources` section to my blog posts where I will be adding all the sources I used to write the blog post.
I am sure that in this day and age of misinformation, this will be very helpful.

## More Unique Content

Everyone does perf tests, everyone does why I use x. I need to find a way to make my blog posts more unique and interesting.
No more explaining guides, no more x vs y posts. I'll have to start writing about my genuine experiences and thoughts.
This is not about just the views or the typical "be yourself" advice. This is about me being more authentic and genuine with my blog posts, because 
I need to remember why I started blogging in the first place: not for a few views, but to share my experiences and thoughts with the world on my _own_ platform.

I plan to bring my unique experiences with development in the blog, give it more personality and make it more interesting to read.
Not the same old LinkedIn post worthy content, but something that is more authentic and genuine.
So, expect less, but _more_ from my blog.

## Forget the Stats

By Stats, I mean the wide umbrella of ReadTime, Views, etc. I have to stop worrying about the stats and just focus on writing.
I love writing and explaining things. I love sharing my experiences and thoughts. I love blogging. I don't want to worry about the stats.
