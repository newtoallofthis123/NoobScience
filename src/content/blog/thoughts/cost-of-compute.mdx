I recently got a new laptop that has about 12 Gigabytes of Memory, and in my opinion, it is one of the smoothest
and durable laptops I have ever used. I use a Lenovo Ideapad 3, that was gifted to me by my aunt. It has a Ryzen 5 3500U
processor, and 12GB of RAM. I have been using it for about 10 months now, and I have not had any issues with it.
It is a great laptop. 

Around the some time after I got this laptop, my friends too started buying laptops of their own. Most bought the new 
gaming laptops that companies like Asus, Acer, and Lenovo were releasing. They had the heavy duty processors, and the
high end graphics cards. They were basically monster trucks in the form of laptops.
